Introductions

This series uses a mixture of omniscient past tense and first person present tense to tell the story of Shades of Gray. I have used bold to separate the first person from the omniscient. Enjoy the series.

If multiple Earths exist, what would their worlds look like? What kind of people would they be? Societies? Religions?

Would they make the same mistakes as us?

Translated from the Assembled Works

Ginn L. Irynkissgthie 525 B.D.C. (Before Dry Clouds)
Prologue

On a parallel Earth, thick puffy barriercumulus also known as Dry Clouds covered the sky and prevented the glimmer of twilight from shining on the city of Noir. For three decades, the polluted high-troposphere looming clouds covered half the planet and left part of the world to live in endless night. The mile-thick clouds yielded petroleum based contaminated water dubbed Tainted Rain and polluted the air and so they were named Dry Clouds for leaving half the planet without drinkable water. At first, scientists believed pollution caused the great cloud barrier but that theory proved to be false. What caused the Dry Clouds to form baffled scientists and how to reverse them eluded reason and only technology's constant battle with nature has kept the dark city alive.

Man's need for conquest expanded Noir to cover more than half a continent of what would have been called North America, and Noir became a Mega-city; it was the only one in the world. Over the last twenty years, Transgenics and bio-mechas evolved at a breakneck pace. Transgenics were genetically modified organisms with an extra-genome and were mostly plants produced to survive without the sun. Bio-mechas were robots resembling living things.

On this world, corporations not governments ruled the people, creating a society where profit set policy and dictated life. Those who resided in Noir were touched by darkness, and the light of goodness seemed a forgotten memory and they... they lived in the gray —Shades of Gray.
Chapter One

The Pandora Project

Isaiah 5:30b

If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and sorrow, even the light will be darkened by the clouds.

The year 31 A.D.C. (After Dry Clouds)...

October 22...

Thursday...

4:44 A.M...

In a secret location known as the Sanctum that housed the main facility of the department known as the Council...

A few hours ago, unknown forces had breached a few of the Council's other facilities, and the Sanctum had also been breached but from within by a Mole, so everyone was still on high alert. The Chamber was the brains of the Sanctum, and the three members of the Council sat within the Chamber, receiving intel and updates from the Chamber Analysts.

Fifty flat screen monitors covered three of the walls and lit up the dark inner room of the Chamber as data filled the screens in scrolling masses. Two dozen analysts scrutinized the influx of information coming across the monitors as they typed at their workstations. The men and women toiled, compiling a range of intelligence from several projects and experiments while they also dealt with the breaches.

"All right people, let's stay focused," a male supervisor shouted.

The male supervisor walked up and down the line of workstations as the hum of equipment and the chatter of the workers filled the area. The supervisor received updated reports from the analysts and kept his employers, the Council, current on the projects and experiments along with updates to the three breaches. A female supervisor came in to fill in for Supervisor Annette who had been found out to be the Mole. Unknown to the Council, Supervisor Annette had been a Mole within the Sanctum for years and with the help of some outside force, she had awakened a project known as Pandora, who had been kept at the Sanctum in stasis.

The male supervisor added, "We need to stay on our toes! We don't know if there are any more Moles within our ranks or what they might do next!"

The analysts wore indigo jumpsuits with white stripes on the sides, and the supervisors wore crimson jumpsuits with white stripes. Both the analysts and supervisors wore a wireless earpiece to communicate with operatives in the field and soldiers within their facilities.

In the center of the Chamber, the Council which consisted of two men and a woman sat at a long rectangular table. Each of them wore a black business suit and had a laptop in front of them as shadows concealed their eyes, leaving only their mouths and chins visible in the computer-blue illumination. The three scanned reports as they were delivered to them by the supervisors on Hand Held Computers. The standard size for an H.H.C. was two and a half inches by four and a half inches.

"I want an update on the Pandora Project," Mr. Morta ordered in a deep voice as he sat at the end of the table with the woman to his right and the other man to his left.

"Pandora is still groggy from its abrupt withdraw from stasis, so it has been escorted to a medical suite and is sleeping," Ms. Nona replied. "The doctor thought it best that the Pandora Project was not fully awakened but allowed to pull out of the hyper-stasis naturally."

"There is nothing natural about the Pandora Project," Mr. Decuma spoke up. "I do not see why we cannot induce a full activation."

"We are not in any hurry," Mr. Morta stated. "We had no plans to wake up Pandora, so we should tell the doctor to allow Pandora to come to on its own."

Ms. Nona nodded her agreement and then Mr. Decuma reluctantly did so.

"Good... Good... I will inform the doctor," Mr. Morta said. "Now to address other matters. I believe we should have a full investigation into how our security was breached. We should–"

An alarm went off, interrupting him as all three Council members paused and turned to the male supervisor as he rushed over to their table.

"What has happened?" Mr. Morta inquired.

The male supervisor replied, "We have a containment breach in another one of our hyper-stasis chambers!"

"Which one?" Mr. Decuma questioned.

"The Kraken Project," the male supervisor answered.

"If I remember–" Ms. Nona started, "–Kraken is the creature created to glimpse into the future."

"It is," Mr. Decuma replied. "It was deemed a failure for Kraken had more of an appetite for carnage than to indulge us with its gifts."

The male supervisor listened to his earpiece and then reported, "It has escaped its room, and it's rampaging on Level 159."

"Level 159 is the same level Pandora is on. Could this also be a part of the earlier attack on our facilities?" Ms. Nona questioned. "Is someone still trying to take the Pandora Project away from us?"

The male supervisor replied, "I do not believe so. An experiment was being conducted next door to the Kraken Project's stasis room, and the experiment went out of control and exploded. The explosion knocked out the hyper-stasis chamber's power source along with its back up, and Kraken awoke, and so far, the creature has killed three of our soldiers."

Mr. Decuma spoke up, "I cannot believe that this is a mere coincidence but..."

"But what?" Ms. Nona inquired when he didn't finish.

Mr. Decuma didn't answer her but posed a different question altogether, "Why not use the Kraken Project to test Pandora?"

"We cannot control Kraken and is the reason it was placed in stasis," Mr. Morta stated, and then he inquired, "How do you propose that we use it to test Pandora?"

"Just evacuate all the workers on Level 159, and Kraken will do the rest for us," Mr. Decuma replied.

Ms. Nona nodded and then Mr. Morta.

"I will set up the test now," Mr. Decuma stated. "I will also make sure that our soldiers keep Pandora and Kraken on Level 159."

Level 159...

Sometime earlier...

The Pandora Project's view...

Someone's calling my name from the darkness... Someone desperately needs my help... I have to save them, so I slip from sleep into the waking world, and the first thing I notice is that I'm cold. I shiver, and then I hear the voice of a man.

"I'm with her now," he says. "I'll call you later when I know more."

I open my eyes to what looks like a hospital room. The sight doesn't alarm me as if it's the norm, but there's someone who's looking down at me that I don't recognize. He... My mind's a little fuzzy... He must be a doctor, and he looks very worried.

"Drink this," he says. "It's water."

I take the bottled water and thirstily drink it down.

"We need to go," he tells me. "Can you move?"

I don't say anything to him as I try to sit up, and I find that I can't do it on my own, so he moves to my side and assists me to a sitting position. I look around the room and realize I don't know how I got here, but I'm still not upset that I'm in a hospital room as if this place is home. I try to think back beyond the moment I heard someone calling my name. I don't remember anything beyond that moment. It's all fuzzy and then panic sweeps over me like water filling a sinking ship that I'm trapped on. I grip his wrist tightly.

"How did I get here and where is here?" I ask him and pull on his arm so that he'll lean in closer, and then I tell him, "I don't remember my name."

My name had been so clear when I was sleeping. I knew it when the person called it out but now... it's as if I never had a name and that thought is what sends me into panic mode, no, sends me into nuclear-panic mode.

"I would like to answer you in more detail than just to say that it's a side effect of the hyper-stasis chamber, but we need to go and go now. Please try to stand."

The urgency of his voice spurs me to action as I take both his hands and stand wobbly to my feet, leaving behind my questions. I see that I'm wearing some sort of hospital gown a second before my knees buckle underneath me. He catches me before I crumble to the ground and then helps me over to a computer chair, and I sit. He hurries over to the door, peers out the window as if he expects someone to come barging in, and then quickly returns to my side.

"I'm going to inject you with something that should help with the hyper-stasis lag," he tells me as he removes a syringe from his white lab coat pocket. "I didn't inject you right away because there is a side effect of the injection. It's going to make you sick, but the effects should only last for a few minutes." He readies the syringe as he tells me, "You should regain full use of your body again."

He doesn't give me a chance to tell him if I want the injection or not, and he just sticks the needle in my arm. The prick hurts, and I rub my arm. I don't feel any different, but gunfire some distance away from us pulls my attention and his to the door.

"We have to go," he tells me with more urgency than before.

I get to my feet with his help, and we head for the exit. He opens the door, peers outside, and then ushers me into a vacant hallway. He helps me along as we hurriedly walk in a direction he seems to be leading us in. We hear gunfire again coming from behind us, and then we hear this terrifying inhuman scream that's full of anger as something attacks the people with the guns.

"A creature has gotten out," he tells me. "We need to run."

I do my best to start running. I have more feeling in my legs, but the side effect he mentioned earlier comes roaring from my stomach. I push myself away from him and lean against the wall as I upchuck the water all over the floor. I continue vomiting as he rushes over to me.

"I know you're sick, but we can't stop. We've got to keep moving. We can't be caught, but we also don't want to run into whatever is coming. We need to move."

I nod and rush after him as he takes me by the hand. He leads me through several hallways, and then he ups and stops before we round another corner. I glance around the corner and see about twenty armed men and a few women at the other end who are set up behind a barrier. The man pulls me back around the corner and out of sight of the soldiers.

"They're blocking our way of escape," he tells me, and then he peers around the corner. "But they don't seem to be coming after us. Maybe they're here not to capture us but–"

The terrifying inhuman scream we heard before sounds through the hallway again and sends shivers throughout my body.

He tells me, "We need to keep moving. We have one other escape route. Let's hurry before the thing beats us to it."

He takes a firm hold of my wrist, and we run forward, fleeing away from the soldiers and the creature that seems to be pursuing us.

"I don't know your name," I say, and then I ask, "Who are you and why are you helping me?"

"You can call me Xavier," he replies. "R.G. sent me to assist in your escape."

Before I have a chance to ask who R.G. is, the creature screams again. It sounds like it's only a few hallways back.

Xavier says, "We need to run faster... It's gaining on us."

We continue running, and then he drags me into a room with only one way in. He shuts and locks the door.

"Why did we come in here?"

He answers, "There's a small elevator that takes medical waste up to a furnace. There's room enough for you to go up. I just need to clear everything out of it."

He unlocks the door to the small elevator by lifting up on a bar, and then he goes to work removing bags of waste from it as all I can do is stand back and watch while I try not to throw up. Bits and pieces of my memory slowly come back, and I remember someone was taking care of me. Her name... Her name was... I can't seem to remember her name or her face, but I believe this person is very important to me and when I think of her, I get a sense of warmth that wraps around me and makes me feel safe like a child in her mother's arms. I relax a little in this loving blanket, but then this other sensation of fear and horror moves in like a closet monster that has just crawled under my bed. The monster makes me want to flee from the memory, but the motherly arms that are blanketing me want me to remain in the memory so that I'll recall all. Something happened before the hyper-stasis chamber... something I'm afraid to remember. The monster yearns to surface and make it mine once again, but I fight the recollection. I war with myself to keep this buried moment in my life a secret. I begin to lose this battle. The memory starts to become mine again, sending a fright so deep and terrifying through my soul, I feel like I'm suffocating. The memory of the woman, whose name I can't remember, places her hand on my psyche's shoulder, and I turn my attention from the monster to her. The monster is scary, but the woman will be there and help me through the–

"I'm almost done," Xavier tells me, interrupting my thoughts. "Come over here and climb in."

"What about you?"

"There's only room for you," he tells me. "Now listen carefully, and I'll tell you what to do once you reach the furnace room."

The creature screams again, and it's right outside the door. It tries the knob but it's locked, so the creature starts pounding on the door to break it down. My whole being lights up with fear.

"I can't leave you here," I tell Xavier. "That thing will kill you."

"You are the one who is important here," he tells me. "R.G. has a plan for you."

I insist, "Either we both go or we don't go at all!"

The creature outside continues to beat at the door, and then it busts through and rushes in. I freeze as I stare at a monster right out of a horror movie. It stands about seven feet tall with reptile-like features and covered in green scales.

The creature pauses and looks right at me as it says, "Look at you... look how you've changed."

Is this the monster that crept from the closet and is hiding under my bed waiting to devour me?

"Do I know you?" I manage to ask it.

"I'm Kraken," it... she answers. "And you should remember me. I've killed you nearly a dozen times." Kraken looks me over, and then she says, "You don't have a weapon this time. I believe I'll have no problem disposing of you."

Fear sweeps over me, but this time it's not for myself but the man who's standing behind me. I turn and shove Xavier into the small elevator, then shut the door, lock the bar back in place, and then hit the button, sending the elevator up.

"Getting rid of the normal, good idea," Kraken tells me. "I have killed quite a few of them already."

I turn back to her and as if I've done this dozens of dozens of times before, I ask, "Why do you want to kill me?"

"Because you're the Pandora Project," she answers. "There's no other reason."

"Pandora... that's not my name," I tell her. "I'm..."

Most of my memories, including my name, still elude me. I'll have to be patient until they surface but first, I have to survive my encounter with this monster.

Kraken peers at me for a long time, and then she says, "You act like you don't remember me."

"Why do you say that?"

She grins before she slithers out, "You aren't running!"

I notice the red blood covering her long claws and that her body is full of bullet holes.

"You're hurt," I say, and I notice how concerned I sound. Maybe I did know this creature before.

"The soldiers tried to prevent me from coming out and stretching my claws. I took of their blood–" she tells me as she places a hand on one of her wounds, "–and they repaid me in kind." Kraken peers at me again as if she's trying to figure out what I'm thinking, and then she says, "You don't remember me, do you?"

"My memory is a little fuzzy since leaving hyper-stasis," I admit to her. "I get a sense that I know you but–"

"But what?" she asks.

"Fear's not the first thing that comes to mind. It's more like... somehow we're alike. Somehow... we... we both shouldn't be in this place."

She lessens her aggressive stance as she tells me, "Shredding you to bits without you knowing the reason why would be a pity. Why don't you tell me what you do remember? Maybe it will jog more of your memories."

"I don't remember you at all. I do remember being forced into the hyper-stasis chamber and forced into hyper-stasis. There's a reason I was placed there. Someone was trying to prevent me from doing something."

"Go on," she urges me. "What were you trying to do?"

"I..."

That particular detail of my memory is still vague. I do remember the distinct sound of–

"Well," Kraken interrupts my thoughts. "What were you trying to do?"

"I was trying to save someone... no... I still need to save someone. I need to go."

"Memories are fickle things," Kraken tells me as if she knows something about me that she's holding to her own. "Memories make us who we are and glean the path before us. Our distorted and bloody intertwining-past comprises a great deal of who you are, but it seems to be my lot that our story is put on hold here. I believe we'll meet again but only when your story is over."

I'm not sure what she means, so I ask, "Are you letting me go?"

Kraken studies me for a few moments more and then moves away from the door, and I slowly move towards it. I start to head out when Xavier appears in the doorway. He's armed with a pipe, and he's holding a cell phone in his other hand.

"It's okay," I tell him before he starts for Kraken. "She's going to let us go."

He takes a step back and then tells me, "Come on. I found another way out for us."

I turn back to Kraken and question her, "Do you want to come with us?"

"No," she replies. "I'll wait here until you remember everything, and then I'll come find you, and we can finally finish everything."

I nod and leave her to her fate, then I head out with Xavier, and we run through several hallways. I keep pace with him until a burst of memories hits me hard, and I double over. Many images and thoughts from my past slam into me, and it's painful to remember so much at once, but I'm thankful for the return of self.

"What's wrong?" he questions me.

"I remember now..." I tell him as I hold my throbbing head and still manage to smile as my purpose becomes joyfully clear. "I remember everything now." I force myself to straighten as I continue, "My name, my mission, and the person I need to save. We have to hurry before it's too late."

Xavier lifts the cell phone he's been carrying to his ear and talks into it as if he's been on the phone with someone this whole time, "She says she remembers everything. Yes... yes... I understand. I'll make sure she gets out safely." He hangs up the cell phone and questions me, "Now what?"

I look around the hallway and for the first time, I know where I am, so I turn away from him and say, "This way. We need to go this way."

"Before we do that..." he starts, so I turn back to him, and he swings the pipe and hits me in the head.

The hallway whirls around me as I crash to the floor. Xavier drops the pipe and hurries to my side with this look on his face like he hit me harder than he planned to.

"I'm sorry, but I can't let you deviate from the path R.G. has set before you," he tells me as he removes another syringe from his lab coat pocket. "This will help reset you, and then you can begin again without any nasty memories hindering your fate."

He injects me, drops the syringe, then removes another device from his pocket, and tells me, "Once I zap you with this, you won't remember anything from the past hour."

I grab at his arms, but I find I don't have the strength to fight him off and that I'm losing consciousness as the head wound pulls me further down into the void I had just woken up from. I claw at him as the purpose I had yearned to remember slowly trickles away.

I plead with him, desperate to hang on to what I just gained, "Don't take my memories... There's something important I need to do and there's someone important I need to save... Please... I can't forget about them, and I can't forget what I need to do. So much depends on me... Please... at least let me save them. Let me..."

"I'm sorry but this needs to be done," Xavier interrupts me, then grabs hold of both my arms, and places the device on the back of my neck.

Everything that I had remembered, the purpose I had finally grab hold of, they all slip away in a brilliance of light, and I remember no more.

End the Pandora Project's view...

Sometime later...

Elsewhere in the Sanctum...

The Chamber...

"The Kraken Project just surrendered to our soldiers," the male supervisor reported to the Council. "It never even engaged the other project."

"What of Pandora?" Mr. Morta inquired.

"Our soldiers believe she escaped from the Sanctum."

Ms. Nona said, "We should have three units of our soldiers give pursuit."

"No need," Mr. Morta spoke. "There are other ways we can test Pandora."

"Are you sure the project is ready?" Mr. Decuma inquired. "It just woke up from hyper-stasis. Maybe we should give it a few more weeks of conditioning before we begin the tests."

"No, launch the Pandora Project," Mr. Morta instructed. "Let us see what it can do on its own."

* * *

6:04 P.M...

In another part of the city...

Scattered streetlights partially lit an abandoned industrial district, and the wind howled, blowing through overgrown weeds and chilled the air of the blue-gray night. Over the years, a few trees and plants adapted to the limited artificial light along with a large variety of weeds. Nocturnal creatures; rats, mice, owls, and cats ruled the alleys and parks of the megacity of Noir.

A black sedan slowly rolled down the street, and its headlights lit up the dark road. The vehicle stopped at the curb a few hundred yards away from Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse, then the four doors of the vehicle opened, and five men in brown suits exited the car. Each of them wore polarized spectacles with black mirror-like lenses, and the spectacles hid more than their eyes. Four of them removed a silver Beretta from their shoulder holster. The fifth man wore a Coffin Handled Bowie tucked in a belt, and the man tapped the hilt eager to draw the knife. Eerily in one accord, they turned their heads and stared at the rusted toy building as they awaited orders. A parking lot stood between them and their target.

Within the Sanctum's Chamber...

"All right people, let's stay focused," the male supervisor shouted as he and the female supervisor walked up and down the line of workstations. "This is the hour we've been waiting for!"

"Has the Pandora Project been located?" Mr. Morta asked in a deep voice as he twirled a gold ring on his dark brown finger.

"Yes, one of our best operatives, Argus, is watching Pandora," the smaller man, Mr. Decuma answered as he smoothed his hand down a bright orange tie.

"Good... Good..." Mr. Morta said. "What does the operative have to report?"

Some distance from Etna Toys...

A man with shoulder-length blond hair wearing a black trench coat peered through specialized binoculars. Argus had positioned himself in an alley a block from the abandoned toy warehouse to watch Pandora. He noted the sedan across the street and the five men, and then he reported them to the Sanctum over a cell phone.

Within the Sanctum's Chamber...

The male supervisor handed an H.H.C. to the third member of the Council.

Ms. Nona frowned as she looked over it, thinning her cherry-red lips which contrasted her powdery white skin. Her frame was the smallest of the members. She stated, "We have received a second report from our operative." She scanned the report a second time, disconcerted over the news and then added, "Argus has spotted five bio-mechas, and they are not Proto-Androids but a new model called Un-Men."

"Un-Men?" Mr. Morta spoke, not as surprised as his female counterpart. "Only one department within the corporation is developing this line of bio-mechas." Disappointed over the untimely intrusion, he exhaled loudly and then stated, "The Factory has started their Un-Men tests. I had hoped they would wait."

"You knew it might happen?" Mr. Decuma questioned as he rubbed his finger over a silver tie pin of the word "Fate".

Mr. Morta nodded as he replied, "Yes, it was only a matter of time but it means–"

"It means–" Ms. Nona interrupted, "–that the Factory has decided to go against the wishes of the Council."

"How dare they!" Mr. Decuma uttered, and then he slammed his palms on the table as he stood and declared, "We must do something!"

"But what?" Ms. Nona questioned.

"More importantly," Mr. Morta started. "What are their plans for our child-like Pandora?"

Back at Etna Toys...

The wind kicked up sand and debris as the five men, the Un-Men, stood by the sedan. Their Internal Link or I-Link, not only connected them to the Factory but to each other and with the I-Link, they could think and move as one. They shut the sedan's doors and simultaneously walked toward the warehouse across the parking lot, but the one with the Bowie paused and turned, spotting a heat signature. The heat signature was of a human hiding in the darkness of an alley that was across the street from it, and the Un-Man could tell the human was watching them. The Un-Man's I-Link blazed orange through the right lens of its polarized spectacles as it processed the data.

Argus moved his hand to the M4 assault rifle strapped over his shoulder as he tensed, not knowing what it would do. Argus had encountered a Proto-android before, and it had nearly killed him, but he had no idea what this new model was capable of. He decided to stay on the safe side and make it clear he wouldn't interfere with their mission, so he moved his hand away from the assault rifle and waited for its reaction. The Un-Man smirked at him, continued toward Etna, and joined its brethren. Argus was relieved it worked and grabbed a hold of the M4 as he moved across the street to continue the surveillance of the project.

Within the Sanctum's Chamber...

"The matter is confirmed. The Factory–" Ms. Nona emphasized the next word, "–has gone against our wishes." She looked at the larger man and questioned him, "What is our next move?"

"Analyze and record," Mr. Morta answered. "Our agenda has not changed. The Un-Men will test Pandora for us."

Within the dark Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse and among boxes of discarded toys and debris, a cot had been set up, and a lamp on a round end table stood beside it and lit up the area in a dim glow. The woman, Pandora, who was in her early thirties slept on the cot. She had a shaven head, and the gash on her forehead which Xavier had unintentionally given her, bled. The trickle of blood flowed past her brow, ran down the side of her face, and dripped to a pillow. The crimson liquid spotted the white cotton case. No other bedding covered the old and worn mattress.

She wore a white V neck T-shirt, gray-black pants, and black hiking shoes. Her eyes rapidly moved underneath her closed eyelids as she dreamed, and her lips moved as she talked within the dream but there was no sound. Her inaudible narration continued until she spoke out loud, "A love that will not die."

Her breathing increased, and her arms and legs jerked in mock movement as she envisioned herself running. Sweat speckled her forehead, and her face grimaced in determination as her mind replayed a memory; it was one that would mark her future with sorrow. Three shots rang out in the dream, then the horrible recollection caused her to scream, and she sat up and frantically searched the building as a panicked feeling urged her to flee.

The Pandora Project's view...

My heart thunders in my chest as I notice I'm alone and not in any immediate danger, so I calm down a little and remember part of the dream. I was running, but there's something I can't remember. Whatever it is, I think it's important enough to recall, so I strain to grasp at the fleeting images, but it's too late. They're gone.

My head hurts, I'm very thirsty, and I feel a little queasy as I examine the old empty building more closely. Parts of teddy bears are scattered about a stack of boxes, and a layer of dust clings to everything like the building and machinery haven't been used in years. I remember more of the dream, not the images but the urgency I felt within it, and a sense that there's something I'm supposed to do or someone I'm supposed to help. The remnants of the dream fade, and I mentally try to grasp for a clue, but it's like trying to capture a dark phantom. The sensations of fear and anxiety remain with me along with the sound of the three shots, but nothing else of the dream remains and that bothers me. Was I pursuing someone or was someone chasing me? Was I the predator or the prey?

I remain on the cot a little longer, hoping something will resurface and tell me how– I gasp and put a hand to my mouth as I realize something that deeply unsettles me, and the revelation frightens me more than not knowing what happened in the dream. I realize I don't know who I am. I can't remember anything past the moment I woke in this warehouse on this cot. I know I should be doing something, but I can't... I can't remember anything. Smothering terror oozes over me like the Blob from the classic horror movie, and its gelatinous glob eats away at my presence of mind, adding my frightened essence to itself. It'll do me no good to panic, and I mentally spray frigid air on the growing Blob, taking back my sanity from its frozen and cracked form.

My head continues to hurt, so I touch my temple, feel a warm wet substance, and examine my bloody fingers. Did I hit my head or did someone hurt me? The thought that someone might have hurt me makes me a little on edge, so I move to the side of the cot, thinking of going to a hospital when I notice a second table; it's square and small and has a few items on it. I pick up a business card with an image of a flaming bird, flip it over, and find a barcode on its back. I set it down, pick up a note, and read it aloud.

"Katharine..."

I study the name, wondering if the name belongs to me. It doesn't sound familiar, so I continue reading, "Katharine, you must not fail. This is your last chance to redeem yourself. I know you can complete your mission, my dearest Kat. I am counting on you."

The note's signed by R.G.

I fold the paper, and then along with the card, I stuff them in my back pocket and decide I need to find help for the wound on my head in case it's serious. I spot a door and start to stand and move for it when a flash of a violent memory makes me turn my attention back to a metal case on the table. Why did I ignore this item? I stretch my hand for it. Why does my heart pound in dread when I reach for it? I pause before grabbing it as a sinking feeling sweeps over me, and I pull my hand back and decide it's best to ignore the enigma. I look at the last object on the table and pick it up; it's a small silver box shaped like a treasure chest and has a small raised star the size of a dime on its lid. I examine the box and then carefully open it, and its tune sweetly rings in my ears. The tune reminds me of the opening of a classical piece, but whose? Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart come to mind, but the piece doesn't seem to belong to either of them, and then I realize I'm wrong; it has elements from each like it's a mixture of several openings playing on top of each other. I close my eyes, letting the music sink in as a calming solace sweeps over me, and the urgency to leave the building slips away as I focus on the tune. While I'm in this state of relaxation and before I'm completely engulfed by it, I wonder about a few things. How do I know all those composers' names and that the piece is Ginn L. Irynkissgthie's Unfinished Melody? Why do I know some things but my own name's lost to me?

Unfinished Melody is short; it plays about thirty seconds, and then it starts over and plays over and over in a hypnotic flow. I gaze at the music box, hearing nothing but the haunting arrangement of compound sounds. My fear and anxiety vanish, and my body relaxes to an absolute state of nirvana as the tune lulls me into a trance. I slowly closed my eyes and enter a peaceful place within my mind. The place is a subconscious oasis to the confusion and dread I experienced before the melody. The tune has a calming effect on me and as I sit there in an ecstatic state, sounds outside of the building become louder and clearer. The wind howls, rustling the leaves of trees and overgrown bushes. A moth repeatedly taps the glass of a street light drawn to the artificial flame as four car doors slam. A cricket chirps, and an owl swoops, landing on a squeaking mouse.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I open my eyes as my heart thumps so loud I can hear it, and I experience an overwhelming sense of hysteria. I put a hand on my chest, not in pain but in horror as I realize something's wrong. I close the music box, place it in my left thigh pocket, and search the building and find it's still empty. I know I'm in danger, but from what? I glance at the case I ignored, and a deep dread lifts in me like a leviathan rising from the ocean's abyss. I freeze as I stare at the metal container; it's like I know what's inside, but my mind refuses to grasp the knowledge and instead, I want to run away from it like it's a maniac chasing me. I disregard my apprehension about the case and turn my attention back to my pounding heart and the urgency screaming at me to leave. The longer I wait to act, the more anxious and terrified I become. I feel like a deer standing in an open meadow, sensing a predator prowling towards me through the tall grass, and I fear I'll be attacked at any moment and from any direction. I get off the cot and start to run when the lamp beside me shatters, and the surrounding area plunges into darkness as pieces of the lamp ping to the concrete floor. I shriek, realizing someone shot at me, and I dive as more bullets whizz overhead. I turn the table over for cover, the case falls, knocking itself open, and a metal object slides from it.

Far from the cot, light from the street dimly shows through Etna's dusty windows. The light provides limited illumination within the building and within its radius, I see a black gun. I gasp, staring at the instrument of death that's an arm's length away. The weapon's familiar to me and yet it seems like some horrendous alien creature that has traveled from a distant planet to wreak havoc on my world. The monster will devour me if it gets a chance, so I scoot a few feet away from the gun. I would escape its psychological jaws trying to sink their terror-inducing teeth into me, but there are other things in the building I have to worry about, so I slowly peek over the table and spot two armed men.

End the Pandora Project's view...

She didn't realize they were actually bio-mechas, and as far as Kat knew, they were ordinary men trying to kill her. They prepared to fire again, and her heart thumped harder as if it would tear through her chest.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

Unknown to her, the muscle coursed artificial adrenaline through her blood, and the synthetic hormone reacted with her body by increasing her heart rate, dilating her pupils, and elevating her blood sugar. Horrified by what was going on within her body and the men shooting at her, she put her hand to her chest again, realizing her heart wasn't acting naturally. She wondered if she was having a heart attack.

The two Un-Men moved toward her position after calculating the best way to kill her. They aimed their weapons at her position with only one goal in mind.

One of them stated in a monotone voice, "Target acquired, moving forward with termination."
Chapter Two

The Rogue

6:43 P.M...

The Sanctum...

Within the dark Chamber...

Desk lamps lit up the faces of the analysts and the supervisors as they observed Pandora's data with interest. The project was very important to the Council and so it was very important to them.

"Lower the center screen," Mr. Morta commanded from the middle of the room.

A screen four by eight-foot lowered long ways from the ceiling, and it positioned above the Council and in the center of their table. The screen could be viewed from both sides, and it displayed an outline of a female body. Each of the major organs was visible on the screen and had bio-data streaming beside them, and the heart had such a large amount of information streaming beside it that the data overlapped the other organs. An alarm sounded within the Chamber and stopped, and at the top of the bio-screen in bold red letters blinked "First Evolvement Achieved". Prattle between the analysts started as charged enthusiasm filled the Chamber, and the supervisors quickly quieted the frivolous talk, knowing their employers would be irritated with them.

"Good... Good..." Mr. Morta said. "Pandora has achieved Ginn's Alpha Phase."

"You mean Arcamedes' First Evolvement," Mr. Decuma corrected.

Mr. Morta questioned, "Does it matter by which name we call it? It is the same thing. It is still the beginning of Pandora's metamorphosis."

"True, but will Pandora take the path Ginn laid out or will Pandora take Arcamedes'?" Ms. Nona asked. "What Pandora decides to do will determine which name the stages go by."

"Until the path is clear–" Mr. Morta started, "–both men's descriptions can be used." He studied the center screen's data on his laptop, and then he spoke, "Pandora's first stage is the ability to sense the presence of bio-mechas as predicted by both men, and Pandora's body is preparing itself to combat the Un-Men. Look at the subject's bio-electricity. The levels are high enough to trigger the Beta Phase."

"Yes," Ms. Nona said. "The genetically altered epinephrine hormone we created for Pandora dubbed Ultra-Epi acts as a supercharged neurotransmitter. If Pandora can reach the next stage, it should have no difficulty dispatching the Un-Men."

" 'If' is the keyword," Mr. Decuma spoke as he tapped across an H.H.C. touch screen and pulled up reports from their operative. "Argus details that Pandora has not responded to the Un-Men's presence." Mr. Decuma turned to his laptop as he stated a question, "Can Pandora achieve the Second Evolvement?" He typed on the keyboard, pulling up more reports. "Pandora seems to be withstanding the conditioning." He stated with concern, "If it does not react soon, the subject will die and the Pandora Project will end."

"Patience," Mr. Morta said. "We did not blindly pick the subject. Wait and see what it is capable of."

Back at Etna Toys...

Katharine's view...

My heart revs like the pistons in a race car as I hide behind the overturned table. Why are the men trying to kill me? Did I do something to them? I glance at the gun lying on the floor beside its open case not too far from me. Or am I a wanted person?

The men fire again, one of the bullets grazes my left shoulder, and the pain triggers a latent instinct within me. I scurry over to the gun, grab a magazine sitting in its case, and insert it into the Beretta with mechanical precision as if I had been programmed to do so without conscious thought. I pull the sliding block, it makes a metal clicking sound, and then I wildly fire six shots over the cot and miss. I freeze at hearing the men's guns cocking and then something inside me clicks like a switch.

A bombardment of information assaults my mind like someone's forcibly downloading all this information right into my brain. Details I shouldn't know, I couldn't possibly know if I was normal, invade my thoughts. My body is changing, and it's scaring the crap out of me but for some reason, I know what's happening to me. The electrical field or e-field of my body changes, and the impulses that would normally travel down the optic nerve surges and causes a split feed. Part of this electricity rushes across my irises and gives my eyes a blue-electrical glow. I can't see this happening and yet, I can see this happening to me. It doesn't hurt, it actually feels good for some reason, but it still scares me. I want to lift my hands and cover both of my eyes like they're on fire to prevent the charged energy from escaping my body. I want to do this, but I don't. Instead, I fire four times like I'd been born with a gun in my hand. I hit one man in the forehead and throat and the other one in the heart and lung. It's like a trained soldier has taken over my body, and I don't realize what I'm doing till it's over. The one I shot in the head collapses to his knees and falls back as the other one fires at me again.

I move back to the overturned table, wondering if the one man's wearing a bulletproof vest. I take a deep breath, rise, return fire, and the bullet hits the second man in the head. He also falls to the floor. Silence follows, and it's a maddening silence that clears my head, lets me think, and lets me realize. My fear turns to uncertainty and uncertainty to self-loathing. I slump to the floor, lean against the table, and bow my head. I can't believe I'm the one who committed the violent actions against those men. I stare at the gun on my lap, trying to distance myself from the incident and fail. Why am I good at killing? Why did I feel nothing for the men I murdered? I put a hand to my mouth as a little bile comes up. I swallow, forcing the bile back down my throat, and it burns all the way, searing my guilt into my soul. Is this the kind of person I am? Am I an emotionless killer?

End Katharine's view...

Within the Chamber...

Mr. Morta cheered, "There!"

Analysts and supervisors high-fived each other.

Mr. Morta looked at the center screen as "Second Evolvement Achieved" brightly flashed from it, and then he said, "The Beta Phase of Pandora's metamorphosis has successfully been reached." He reviewed a report from Argus. "Our operative has seen Pandora's extraordinary shooting ability, and he believes when Pandora is in the Beta Phase, it cannot miss. It has far exceeded our expectations for the Beta Phase. We believed Pandora would have an aptness for terminating bio-mechas but this..."

"Yes," Ms. Nona agreed. "It will be a useful skill."

Mr. Decuma interjected, "If it is true."

"The data supports it and Argus witnessed it," Mr. Morta stated and then inquired, "What more do you need to believe?"

Mr. Decuma replied, "More data perhaps or–"

"I want to know," Ms. Nona interrupted, excited about the outcome, and then she questioned, "Do you think Pandora can reach the Gamma Phase today?"

"I believe we are jumping ahead," Mr. Morta replied. "There are still three Un-Men remaining."

"Yes, and does Pandora have skill or is it mere luck?" Mr. Decuma asked. "More than half of the Un-Men remain. Can it defeat them as easily as the first two?"

At Etna Toys...

Katharine's view...

Leaves and other debris blow in through the open front door as I stand and make my way on shaky legs to the men I've gunned down. I still feel queasy as if at any moment I'll spill my guts all over the floor as guilt continues to shame me to pain and when I reach the men's side, I find a black oil like liquid oozing from the hole in their heads. They aren't human, they're... I remove the polarized spectacles of one, revealing not fleshy eyes but glassy robotic ones. The colored orbs shudder as power surges through its body, the spheres bug out, and its hands gnarl with the mechanical pangs of death. I stare at its eyes. The red rings with black centers show no spark of life. They're merely windows to the soulless.

Relief pours over me as I realize they're not human. I didn't kill anyone, and I'm not a murderer but... Did I know it before I shot them or am I still a cold-blooded killer? My queasiness eases up a little, but my confusion remains as I realize they're bio-mechas, model Un-Men. Why do I know this fact when I can't remember the simplest thing like my name? I search them, find a spare magazine on each of them, and place the ammo in my right thigh pocket.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I sense more bio-mechas and this time, I know their location. It's like I'm connected to them somehow. Three of them walk the grounds outside less than fifteen feet away from me, and they're making their way in here. I frantically search the plant for an escape as the Un-Men split up, and one of them walks through a side entrance. The Un-Man fires at me as I run and take cover behind a row of machinery. Sparks fly as bullets ricochet off of metal, and I cover my head. During the attack, I lose my concentration and the position of the other two, so I blindly dash for the front door as more bullets whizz by. I return fire and hit my mark, and then I continue to the door. I glance back at the third Un-Man as it lies face down. I try to regain the position of the last two Un-Men, but they suddenly appear in the doorway in front of me. I try to stop my forward momentum, but I can't and run into one. It's like running into a wall, and I bounce and fall backward and then with speed that can't be normal, I fire twice before landing on my side. I strike the floor hard and knock the wind out of me. The first shot disables the Un-Man with the gun, but the one with the Bowie sidesteps my second shot with electrical speed as if the Un-Man anticipated my actions before I took them. I inhale, sucking in needed air as I hold my hurting ribs. The Un-Man draws its large knife and stares at me curiously. None of the others had done that, and it creeps me out to the point that I'm more afraid of it than any of the others. The dot of light I see in its sunglasses glows brighter and brighter until it appears as if half the Un-Man's face is burning. I'm looking at some sort of demon!

"The Pandora Project..." the Un-Man sings out, not in the usual monotone of its brethren. The orange colored dot-light changes to a deep red, a blood-red, and the Un-Man gazes at me as if probing my soul. "Pandora..." Its voice is sadistically mellow and toys with me, making me feel violated. "Pandora, I have found you." The Un-Man smiles as if it takes pleasure in the hunt, and it states, "Target acquired." It takes a step towards me, and I scurry backward on my hands and feet as the Un-Man says, "Moving forward with termination."

It lunges for me with the blade and misses as I roll out of the way. The Un-Man's blade strikes the concrete, and the force cuts into the floor. I rise to one knee some distance from it, aim, and pull the trigger. Nothing happens! The gun's empty! I pull the trigger, again and again, hoping a bullet will magically materialize and fire. The Un-Man slowly stands from its kneeling position, takes two quick steps towards me, and kicks me in the ribs. I grab my side and hurry to my feet, pushing through the pain as the Un-Man slashes towards me. I leap back and defensively lift my hands, and the blade cuts across my left forearm. I cry out in pain as blood splatters to the gray floor as the Un-Man finishes its swipe.

The Un-Man wipes the red plasma from the blade with its fingers, and its face beams as if relishing in the combat.

"The Pandora Project," it whispers, fooling with me as if I'm some insect it's going to squash. "Pan... dora..."

The Un-Man attacks again with the blade, and the air screams with each slash as if the knife cuts open its airy belly and spills out its gaseous guts.

The Un-Man coos, "Pandora, I have found you."

I barely evade the attacks and then run, rushing deeper into the dark building. I'm so afraid... I want someone to save me. I don't want to be here. Someone help me... I continue running as dread molests my entire being. I have to escape this nightmare, so I keep looking around as I tell myself it's because I'm searching for a way out, but I can't fool myself. I'm hoping someone will appear. I'm hoping someone will be my Superman or Lassie, but no one comes to my rescue. I'm on my own, and as much as I don't want to be on my own, the fact still chases after me intent to destroy me as much as the Un-Man wishes me harm. I keep fleeing as I eject the empty magazine from the Beretta, drop it to the floor, and pull one from my pocket. I insert the new one in the magazine well, chamber a round, and fire twice behind me, and the Un-Man continues after me, ducking the shots. Is this what I was dreaming about? I'm not the predator but the prey?

End Katharine's view...

Within the Chamber...

Mr. Morta said, "Not bad for the opening test. Pandora achieved the first two phases. It delivered uncanny accuracy with the weapon we provided and successfully sensed the bio-mechas and once it has achieved all the phases, Pandora will be the perfect weapon." He drummed his fingers together as he ordered, "Set up another test so we may analyze the range of its gifts and send Pandora down the path to perfection."

Mr. Decuma nodded and typed up the documentation for the next test, and then he asked the male supervisor standing next to him, "Are the new reports on the project ready?"

"They'll be right over," he answered and then went back over to the analysts and within a minute, the supervisor approached, stating, "Here are the reports you requested on her, Mr. Decuma."

"Her?" the Council said in unison.

"Yes, her," the supervisor answered. He was taken aback by their reaction and asked, "Did I say something wrong?"

"We do not refer to Pandora as she or her," Mr. Decuma reprimanded. "It is an experiment and is to be referred to as such." In disdain, he added, "To say she or her in reference implies Pandora has rights." Mr. Decuma made it quite clear as he stated, "It has none."

"Of course, Mr. Decuma," the supervisor apologized as he handed him the H.H.C. "My error. It won't happen again."

He returned to monitoring the analysts.

Ms. Nona scanned the bio-data on the large center screen and then said, "There seems to be no adverse reaction to the Ultra-Epi, though, complications could arise in the future. Also, Pandora's body is not rejecting the adrenal gland we genetically altered to create the supercharged epinephrine." She made a few notes. "We will have to monitor Pandora for any palpitations, tachycardia, anxiety, headaches, tremors, acute pulmonary edema, and hypertension."

Mr. Morta stated, "We will see if it was wise to alter the gland instead of administering injections."

Mr. Decuma finished setting up the test, and then he said, "The Factory will be more than happy to assist us in the next field trial as one of our sister departments in the Sphinx Corporation."

"The fact that they are developing the Un-Men as their new line of bio-mecha assassins does not hurt us either," Ms. Nona added.

"Yes," Mr. Morta agreed. "The Factory's earlier line of bodyguards was very profitable for the Sphinx Corporation, and now the Factory hopes to improve their power and standing by releasing an unmatched line of bio-mecha assassins. Pandora is an ideal forum to refine the Un-Men's programming." He smiled, pleased with the project, and then he added, "With Pandora's help, the Factory will be able to create the perfect killing machines, and in turn, the Factory will help us test Pandora and help Pandora achieve its purpose. The one seen by Ginn that will–"

"Or Arcamedes," Mr. Decuma interrupted. "We still do not know the path it will take."

Ms. Nona stated, "You are correct and only time will reveal its path."

The female supervisor handed the councilwoman a report, and Ms. Nona said, "There seems to be a problem. Pandora has been unable to disable one of the Un-Men." Ms. Nona re-checked the report, and then she stated, "It is a Type Four model."

"Terminate the test," Mr. Morta ordered, sitting upright. "Request that the Factory recall its bio-mecha. Pandora destroyed four of the five Un-Men. It has done exceptionally well."

"The Factory reports a problem. The Un-Man has ignored its recall," Mr. Decuma relayed. "It seems they have a rogue on their hands."

"A rogue, you say?" Mr. Morta questioned. "The Un-Man must be exceptional in its own right to have survived this long against Pandora. The very fact of it is most interesting."

"Yes, like I said a rogue," Mr. Decuma answered and then asked, "Shall I have Argus assist the project?"

"No, not at this time," Mr. Morta replied, and then he calmly folded his hands, leaned back in the chair, and spoke, "Pandora must learn to survive on its own. We not only need to develop Pandora's untested body but its young undeveloped mind and character. What better way to develop character than to face adversity? In the past, great warriors went up against other great warriors to test their mettle. Strength and endurance grow through conflict as steel sharpens steel, and so the Rogue will be Pandora's adversary."
Chapter Three

Kimberly Griffin

About one year later...

32 A.D.C...

October 12...

Tuesday...

7:59 P.M...

The Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office towered over the streets of the Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage. When the city was created, the Corporate Senate, which was made up of corporations from all over the world, divided Noir into hundreds of sectors, and each sector was owned and governed by one of the corporations. The sectors were then divided by each corporation into smaller areas called vicinages. Sphinx owned and ruled the Hellenistic Sector. Each corporation policed its sector with its own corporate military. The world had its own civil police force which dealt in non-corporate issues like assaults, murders by non-Closers, and anything else the corporate military kicked to them. Authority always belonged to the corporations.

The Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office was one of many massive buildings in Noir. It was a mile high, and half a mile across and back. It stood as a giant in the city and dominated as a Titan before the age of Zeus. A woman in her late thirties sat alone within a waiting room on Level 150 and in her left hand, she held a keychain of a pink bunny rabbit.

Kimberly's view...

I stare at the keychain as I rub my thumb over a worn spot on the rabbit's cheery face. This little metal object is something that I must hold on to. I have to burn into my subconscious what happens when I mess up even just a bit. I must always be professional when it comes to my job. I must keep this keychain as I must keep my silent vow.

I tuck the keychain in my pocket, and then I rake a few blonde strands behind my ear. I look at a man's picture on the cover of the Conglomerate World magazine lying on a coffee table. The headline reads, "Topa, Climbing the Ladder of Success?"

I shift my position on the light brown couch and glance at the secretary. The older woman types on a keyboard. I impatiently sigh and turn my gaze to a few landscape paintings decorating the open room's white walls. Their purpose is to soothe those who wait, and they're supposed to take one's mind away from the stresses of the day. The paintings incite no such solace within me, and I sigh again and this one leaks from my lips drowning in weariness. I turn to the secretary as the woman answers the phone on her desk.

The secretary hangs up, clears her throat, and says, "Ms. Griffin, your father..." The secretary catches her own slip and then corrects herself by saying, "I'm sorry, I mean the Chairman will see you now."

I nod, too tired to be irritated, straighten my aqua pantsuit, and head for the huge corner office. The Chairman's position ranks third under the President and Vice President and since Sphinx is one of the more powerful corporations in the world, that makes my father a very influential man with vast resources and global connections. I pause outside his office, mustering up enough strength to hide my vexation for being called in right after I had flown back in from a job. I just returned from the Light Side of the planet, and I really just want to go home and sleep. I take a deep breath, silencing my anger, then open the door, and walk in.

Two of the walls within the office consist of ten-foot-high windows, and the office's bright lights reflect off the windows like mirrors. The Chairman's desk sits off from the corner, giving him even more presence of authority like a king on a throne. I close the door. He glances up from his computer and stares at me with his light blue eyes as I enter. He's in his late sixties but looks much younger around fifty, and he wears a dark gray suit.

"Kimberly, good to see you," my father says, stands, walks over to me, and kisses me on the cheek. I don't return his affection and almost turn from him like I'm repulsed. My father tries not to show his disappointment as he motions to one of the chairs in front of his desk. I sit as he returns to his seat, and then he questions me, "Are you still living in the apartment off of West 1000 Avenue?"

I'm uneasy being in his office, but I bear the discomfort. I notice his black hair's graying slightly, but everything else about him looks the same. I answer, "Yes."

He waits a moment before continuing. I guess he's hoping I'll say something more and when I only stare at him, my father asks me, "Are you seeing anyone?"

I don't answer him. As if I have time for a boyfriend but that's none of his business. Actually, anything that's personal is no longer his business.

He sees my glare and quickly moves to the next question. I hope he's feeling as awkward as I do sitting here like we're some sort of family. My father asks, "How's work?"

I answer still feeling a bit fatigued, "Fine. I finished a Closing in Moscow three days ago." My harsh and annoyed attitude softens for a few moments as I put my hand in my pocket and grasp the bunny rabbit keychain.

My father must notice the change in my demeanor, and he starts to ask, "Are you all..?"

I glare at him, stifling his question as my vexation returns, and I release the keychain and pull my hand out of my pocket. I'm getting too upset about everything, so I let my training take over. I calm all the emotions that seem to be flinging about in the muck and once I do that, I try to treat him like I would an employer. It works for a few seconds, but then I glance at the back of a picture frame sitting on his desk, and my anger returns.

"You didn't call me in here because you suddenly have an interest in my life."

He says, "Right, to business then."

My father hands me an envelope, and I opened it and see a brass key inside.

"It's to your mother's hope chest," he tells me as he picks up the picture frame. "How you look like her?"

My father sets the frame back down. I can almost see the happy memories he must be thinking about. I see them too, but then bitterness rises in the back of my mind, and the memories fade.

He tells me, "I know she would have wanted you to have the chest. I've set up delivery."

"Why are you giving me the hope chest? Is it because it's close to the anniversary of when mom left?"

"No."

"So why now?"

He doesn't understand my meaning, and he repeats, "Why now?"

"All these years since mom–" I pause, trying not to cry. "–since mom abandoned us, you've never wanted to talk about her and her name became taboo around you, so why now after two decades? Why give me her hope chest? What has changed?" I grow suspicious of his actions. "I know it's not our relationship, so what is it? Are you going to talk about why she left us?"

He replies, "I know I was wrong. When she left me... When she left us I was devastated. It hurt me so much I wanted to forget her. I never thought how it might affect you or that you needed me, and for that, I'm sorry."

"Sorry," I repeat and then laugh. "Perfect, now everything's fine." I stand and start for the door as I add sarcastically, "I'm glad I came."

"Do you have to leave? I thought we might have a late dinner and talk."

I walk halfway to the door, turn, and answer him, "I can't. I have a Closing tomorrow and need to get some rest."

"A Closing? Who?"

"Topa."

"Yes, I know him."

"Thought you did," I tell him as I start to turn toward the door, pause, and say, "It's kind of sad."

"What is?"

"Our relationship, my life, you name it, but most of all that you were the one who got me into–" My next words slither from my mouth, "–my profession." I fist my hands as I question, "What kind of father has his daughter trained to be an..?"

I glare at him too angry to finish and this time, he has nothing to say. I continue to the door.

My father stands and speaks after me, "You should take some time off. You're looking a little tired. Maybe buy yourself a pet to keep you company. You can't be happy living all alone."

"You have been spying on me!" I accuse him after I pause at the door. I start to say something but decide against it and walk through the door.

Mr. Griffin's view...

I sit down after my daughter leaves, then I face the picture and repeat my earlier phrase, "How you look like your mother?" I push my chair back and command, "Lights dim."

The room darkens, and I turn in my seat, staring out a window at Noir's skyline. I gaze at the Dry Clouds as they loom over the dark city, and I speak in nearly a whisper, "I wish you were here, Theresa. Our daughter needs you."

* * *

Kimberly's view...

I drive my red VX Corvette into the parking garage of the Nexus Apartments. The small forty story building sits on the corner of West 1000 Avenue and Knot Street in the Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage. I exit the vehicle and grab a bag of groceries from my trunk, and then I take an empty elevator to the thirty-first floor and walk down a deserted hall to Apartment H.

Sometimes I...

I command in a clear voice, "Door, unlock."

"Voice recognized as Kimberly Griffin," the Apartment Computer System states. "Opening door."

The apartment door slides sideways, and then I walk into the small entry and command, "Door lock."

The door slides shut and locks as I go into the kitchen. The lights automatically flicker on in each room I enter as the Apartment Computer System or A.C.S. detects my presence.

"Welcome back, Ms. Griffin," A.C.S. states in a female computer voice. "The apartment's temperature is set at seventy-eight degrees Fahrenheit. Lights are set at eighty-five percent brightness. Would you like to make any adjustments at this time?"

"Yes, A.C.S. It's a bit warm. Drop the temperature to seventy-six, and I could use more lighting so change the brightness to ninety-five percent."

"Making changes now."

The air conditioner kicks on, and the lights brighten as I set down the bag and lay the keychain beside it on the kitchen counter. I put both of my hands on the inky-black surface, lean against it, and tilt my head down.

Sometimes I wish...

My blonde hair falls forward, covering the side of my face as I peer at my reflection in the marble. For Ares' sake! My life's so tedious! I lean back. All I have is routine. I start to unpack the bag and glance around the dark lifeless room, and it's quiet in a gloomy way. I look at one of three windows in the apartment and notice a dead Transgenic Vine sitting on the kitchen window sill.

Great, just great! I forgot to ask the manager to water it while I was gone; it's too bad A.C.S. doesn't have a watering system for plants. I walk over to the vine, pick up the pot, and several brown leaves float to the floor. I move to the trash can and press the step, and it flips up a stainless steel lid. The brittle brown plant falls out of its container as I drop the pot in the waste, and dirt spills, exposing the vine's roots. I stare at the dead plant. Can't I keep one thing alive? I release the lid and walk away from the trash. Or are Closings all I'm good at?

I return to my groceries. I put the eggs and milk in the refrigerator, put the dry goods in the pantry, then place a stainless steel kettle full of water on the burner, and turn it on high. I reach up into the cupboard, remove a white cup and saucer, and place them on the counter. I walk to a drawer, open it, and grab a spoon. Is this really my life? I notice my reflection in the spoon's curved surface. My life's mundane and lonely.

Sometimes I wish...

I place a single tea bag in the solitary cup and a slice of lemon on the saucer.

Sometimes I wish...

I glance at the answering machine as the water starts to boil. The number on the machine reads zero messages; it's the number of my friends and the same number of my acquaintances. The kettle whistles, and I remove it from the burner, pour hot water into the cup, and steam rolls up from the liquid. Shouldn't my life be different? Wasn't I meant for more than this... this wretched life as a Closer? I wish I had... No, it's better if I dare not think it and dare not hope it.

I grab a remote from the counter and aim the device at the wall. I click on a fifty-inch TV that hangs over a fireplace, and then I gaze at the picture from the open kitchen. The evening news is on, showing footage of a small office building on fire. I move behind a black leather couch and watch the blaze and out of the corner of my eye, I catch sight of the first door in the hallway, walk to the room, start to command it to unlock, but stop myself. Sometimes... I pull on my left earlobe. I wish...

The spare bedroom has remained lock since I first closed it. I stored my mom's belongings in it. My bedroom the master bedroom is down the hall. I return to the kitchen, grab the remote, and look at the TV, and an anchorwoman, Linda Harvey with NBS (Noir Broadcasting Station) reads a report.

"The Corporate Senate will be meeting later this week to vote on the proposed bill for a sales tax increase. The quarter-cent raise will bring in much-needed money for the planet's civil defense and continue funding Research Project Clean Air. Analysts are predicting the bill will be voted in." Linda Harvey pauses. "In other news, Dr. Robert Seeker the foremost expert on the Dry Clouds problem will be heading out to Antarctica to–"

I turn off the TV, plunging the room back into silence. Enough with the news. My life is pathetic enough without having to hear about someone else's miserable existence. I pick up the saucer and cup, walk to a small round table, sit, and stare out the window. The Dry Clouds entomb the starry sky, leaving the night dismal and bleak just like my life. I pick up a clear plastic container of honey that's in the shape of a bear, pop open the yellow lid, and squirt a smiley face on the spoon with the golden sugar.

I whisper a phrase my mom used to say, "Fly... fly away, sad, sad day."

I stir the honey in my Orange Pekoe, remove the tea bag, place it on the saucer, and stare at the now warm brown liquid. The phrase used to cheer me up but not anymore. I arch my head back, looking at the ceiling. Hades... What a life I have?

I open my hand and gaze at a star burned into my right palm. The only constant in my life seems to be it; it has been with me for nearly two decades, and I can't remember where I got the burn. I make a fist and open my hand again. Oh for Ares' sake! Look at me! The only thing I have to look forward to is maybe someday discovering where I received this burn. Hades! I slam a fist on the table, and the teacup rattles. Sometimes I wish... I wish I wasn't so alone! I wish I had more in this life and that there would be someone there for me.

October 13...

Wednesday...

5:49 A.M...

Kimberly's view...

A laptop sitting on the desk in my bedroom screeches like a bird and alerts me to an incoming message.

"No," I whine, place a pillow on my face, and roll over in my bed. "It can't be morning."

A screensaver of a flaming bird flies across the laptop, and the fiery glow lights up the dark room and after a few minutes, I drag myself out of bed. I put on a white housecoat and slippers, fix a cup of hot chocolate, and sit down at the desk. I hit the space bar, wake up the laptop, and click on the message.

It reads, "Have you accepted the Life Closing?"

Voice you're up early this morning. I take a sip of my hot chocolate. Or maybe you're up late, depending on where in the world you're sending this message from. I type a reply, "Yes."

"I'll send an encrypted email with directions," Voice types back. "He should be in his office for most of the morning."

"Standard operation?"

"Yes."

"Understood."

I push my chair back, but the computer's beep grabs my attention.

"You should take a break after this Closing," Voice writes. "You have been working rather hard, and the Moscow Closing was rather difficult."

"You sound like my father. Are you sure you don't have children?"

"Yes, in our line of business it isn't wise to have them," Voice types. "As for your father, you should listen to us, we are your elders."

"Since we're getting a little personal, I was wondering why you're called Voice? All these years I've worked for you, I've never heard you speak."

"Long before you joined us, I made contact over the phone and received the tag."

I type, "I'm also curious as to why you wanted me to join the Assassins League. I do live on the planet's Dark Half. I should be a part of the Assassins Union."

"And let Thanatos have one of the best Closers. I think not. He would only waste your talents, and anyway, those of us on the Light Side still have work that must be done in the Dark Half. You aren't the only Closer there that belongs to the League."

I stretch, yawn, and type, "Will contact you this evening. Signing off."

I go into the kitchen to fix myself some breakfast. I'll need a lot of fuel for the upcoming job. I glance at the trash and think of the dead plant. Maybe I do need a break. I just don't think I have room in my life for a pet. I notice the keychain on the counter and begin to brood. The last Closing really got to me. I grab the keychain, walk to the living room, and move to a bookcase beside the fireplace. I place the keychain in a wooden box sitting on a shelf and glance at a picture frame with a photo of my mom. I've been told that I look so much like her when she was young we could be twins divided by the ages.

I whisper, "Mom, if you were here, what would you think of me? I wish you had never left. I wish more than ever that you would be here for me." I pause and then question, "What would you think of my pathetic life?"
Chapter Four

Topa's Estate

8:48 A.M...

On the outskirts of the Hellenistic Sector...

Katharine's view...

I see Topa's estate in the distance, and it's in the midst of an apple orchard. Sunlamps light up the imported trees as a gentle wind sweeps through the orchard's green leaves. The lamps are on sixteen hours and off eight for places like these and if they didn't use the sunlamps, the non-Transgenic trees would starve in the endless night and die without them. I'm like those trees. I'm starving from the lost of the only light I had in my life, and I'm slowly dying. I'm dying from my heart out. It shouldn't have happened, and it's my fault that it did.

Fruit trees here in Noir are rare, so the place should be a good thing to see, but a lot has happened to me lately. My heart burns with sadness and rage, and the only thing I can think of is he'll pay for taking away my light, so I continue forward with my plan. I walk up a winding path from the darkness of the day and the path leads me to the square mile estate. That's how I feel. I feel like I'm emerging from darkness into blacker shadows, and I swear to myself that he'll pay for killing Preacher. I don't care anymore about what's right or wrong. I'll make him pay for taking the only light in my world.

I trudge forward, determined to go through with my grim plans. The past year's nonstop hunts, what the Council calls tests, have taken their toll on me mentally and physically, but what happened yesterday... it... it can't be ignored.

My pants and shoes are worn and dirty but not as worn out as me. They're the same ones I had on when I woke up at Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse. Life is hard here in the Hellenistic Sector, but I couldn't complain, not until yesterday. I remove a single strap backpack as grief wraps its arms around me and won't let go. I unzip my gray-black athletic jacket, and my chest hurts as anguish presses against it like a heavy boulder. The jacket covers my dingy white t-shirt and protects me from the cool breezy air, but it does little against the sorrow that chills me to my soul. I take off the jacket, remove a black Ravlek Vest I carry on the outside of my backpack, and put the vest on. Ravlek's an experimental material like Kevlar but generations ahead, and seeing the vest makes me think about my life as it is. It's almost been a year since I awoke in Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse and so much has happened. I've created memories, and I've learned what it means to care for another person and how to trust. I've learned what love and devotion are... but now all of that's gone along with Preacher.

I glance at the Ravlek Vest as if it'll console me. I acquired the body armor months ago from an assassin who died from a fall when he attempted to take my life. I worked so hard over the past year not to kill anyone who came after me, and I haven't failed yet, but the assassin still died, and he wasn't the first to lose his life in his pursuit of me. I cried so hard after the assassin died as if I had been the one to kill him. My heart has changed so much since then... since they took Preacher away from me. I no longer care if someone dies. I actually want to kill Topa and make him feel as much hurt as I do now, so I force myself forward. I set the backpack and the jacket beside a dead gnarled oak. The tree's a remnant from the sun era just as Preacher's a remnant of a future I'll never have, not since Topa killed him. I move forward but have no sense of my own actions, engulfed by an overpowering heartache, and I move as if I'm a robot fulfilling a programmer's command. The shock of seeing someone I deeply care for die in my arms numbs me to the bone. I want to scream out but that would give away my position, so I remain quiet and keep my grief within me. This is a nightmare... It has to be a bad dream. Preacher can't be dead.

I continue up the path in a dismal drudge toward my grizzly objective as a hatred overshadows my grief and suffering. The constant struggle between me and the Un-Men seems to have persisted for ages. I'm always the prey, always running and hiding, but not this time. My foes, the Council who sends human assassins and the Factory who sends the Un-Men after me, remain in the darkness and beyond my reach. Today's different... I know one of their names and one of their places of safety. I grip my gun and in my left hand, I carry a white book smeared with blood. Topa will pay. Rage fuels my exhausted body, revenge fixates my mind, and anguish rips at my spirit. He took the most precious thing in the world from me, so he has to pay. I stare at the book as I slowly die inside. For Preacher, I'll kill and I'll break an oath I made to myself long ago.

End Katharine's view...

Behind an iron gate, four men armed with handguns stood beside a brick guardhouse. Two of them talked while the other two walked their designated area. The gate was the eastern of four entrances, and a fifteen-foot wall of stone surrounded the estate. Three of the men wore a Winnow Mask type B or WM-B. The air filters covered their mouths and noses, and the masks permitted those not used to the Dark Half of the planet to work outside in the Dry Clouds' pollution.

The lead guard moved away from the man he was talking to, pressed a button on the side of his WM-B, and shouted to the woman in the distance through the mask's intercom, "Halt! State your name and business here!"

Katharine's view...

I don't respond, consume with a murderous grief and continue my war march toward them.

The four men move to the gate and position themselves to fend off my attack as the lead guard shouts, "She's wearing a vest. Switch to A.P.Rs."

The four men eject their 9 mm magazines and replace them with the Armor Piercing Rounds.

The lead guard declares, "We'll open fire if you don't state your name and business here!"

"My name?" I question. "My name? I'm Sorrow! I'm Emptiness!"

"She has a gun!" the lead guard shouts. "Take her out!"

The four men shoot at me, hitting me in the chest, and I lurch back with the impacts as images of Preacher flash through my mind. I cry out in pain, seeing him die in my arms over and over again. I fall face down to the path, and I exhale from the impacts as if it's my last breath. Fireflies dance about me and the surrounding area, paying no heed it's morning. I watch them and wonder if they can feel sorrow, and then my eyes slowly close as I slip into despair's embrace.

End Katharine's view...

The lead guard ordered, "You two, go check on her."

They stepped out of the gate, scanned the surrounding darkness to make sure she was alone, and then approached her. The second guard rolled her over, Kat moaned, and he noticed blood covered her shirt underneath the vest.

He said, "She's as good as gone." The second guard reached down, took her weapon, tucked it in the front waistband of his pants, then grabbed the book, and said, "This could be valuable." He searched her pockets, then scanned the area again, and spoke, "She has no ID or business card on her, so she isn't a Closer. She must be a nut job. See anyone else?"

"No," the third guard replied and then after taking another look across the surrounding land, he said, "Take her arms. The orchard could use more fertilizer."

The two guards dragged her inside the gate and dropped her on the dirt path.

"What's that?" the fourth guard asked. He wore no Winnow Mask since he was a native of Noir.

The second examined the item he held and then replied, "A book covered in blood."

"A book you say. Is it legal?" the maskless guard asked.

The second opened the cover, peered at a paper tucked in a clear plastic pocket, and replied, "Yeah, it's legal. Here's its registration." He read the top and said, "The Bible's registered to one Norman Odin."

"A Bible?" The maskless guard walked over, grabbed the book, and flipped through it. He handed it back to the second, walked over to her, and told him, "Throw that archaic thing away before you get some disease." He snarled his nose up at her, then spat on her, and said, "She looks like she's from Wayfaring Lane. Bums, the lot of them."

"I thought I might get some money for the book off the black market," the second said.

The maskless guard folded his arms, shook his head, and said, "Not from that thing, you won't. It's trash." He threw his thumb over his shoulder and ordered him, "Toss it!"

The second nodded, then went, and dropped the book on top of the garbage that sat in a trash can outside the guardhouse.

"Better let the boss know about this," the maskless guard said as he started to bring a radio up to his mouth.

Katharine's view...

"I wouldn't do that just yet," I exclaim to get his attention as I grab a hand full of dirt, and then I quickly stand and throw the dirt in his face.

The maskless guard cries out, covering his eyes with his hands, "I can't see!"

"How's she standing?" the lead guard shouts as he draws his gun. "I thought you killed her!"

"I did!" the third man exclaims as he aims his weapon at me and shouts, "She's covered in blood!"

I hold my chest in pain from the four earlier bullet impacts that struck my Ravlek Vest as I tell them, "It's not my blood." I jump up, spin kick the third guard in the temple, and then yell, "Why do you think I'm here?"

The third guard falls to the ground out cold as the lead and second guard shoot at me. I roll with extraordinary speed, evade their fire, then race to the lead guard as he shoots again. The bullet nicks my earlobe. I grab his wavy hair, whack the side of his head into the brick guardhouse, and side kick the second guard in the stomach. The lead guard slides down the brick wall, landing in a heap, and blood covers his forehead. The second guard bends over in pain after I kicked him, and then I calmly approach the second guard, take my gun from his waistband, pull his mask down, and punch him in the face. He starts to choke without the mask.

"I can't see!" the remaining guard screams again. "What's going on?"

I march over to the blinded man, place the barrel of my gun against his jaw, take his weapon, and then demand, "Where's Topa?"

"I won't tell you."

With calm resolve, I lean to him and whisper, "I'm only here to kill him but that doesn't mean I'll let you live if you don't tell me." I put my hand on his back, pull myself close to his ear, and say, "Tell me, and I'll let you live."

Sweat beads my forehead, and a salty droplet runs down my face, landing on the barrel. He squints at the fallen guards, and he must only see blurry images of what looks like dead men.

"Live like the others?" he questions.

I glance at one of them as that guard moans, and then I say, "They're alive. Now... Where's Topa?"

"I won't..."

I cock the gun and state in a voice that I hope makes him feel the presence of death, "Last chance."

"He's... He's in his office. Don't kill me!"

I uncock the gun, then use the man's own weapon, and strike him in the back of the head, knocking him out. I toss his gun, search the other men, and take their 9 mm ammo and what A.P.Rs. they have. I place the magazines in my pocket and toss their guns and masks into the bushes.

I start to walk to the guardhouse to retrieve the Bible from the trash can, but I pause and look at my trembling hands. I know this rage's not me, but I can't stop myself now. I continue to the trash can, pick up the book, brush debris from its blood dried cover, and hold it close to my heart.

I don't understand why they killed Preacher. Was it because of me or was it another test? My lips tremble as anguish shreds my heart into thousands of hurting pieces. Guilt saturates my thoughts as sadness attacks my being and my own mental accusers taunt me. They won't let me forget that I can do nothing to save the man I love. The accusations press against me and make it hard for me to breathe, but I won't let that stop me. I have gone this long grueling year without killing anyone. I took careful steps not to take a life and always found other ways to defeat the human assassins and bounty hunters the Council sent after me. I know it's wrong to kill but still, if I'm the reason Preacher's dead, then I have to kill Topa. It's all I can do for Preacher. If I can't even shed a tear for him, then I'll take...

I break down, collapse to my knees, and pound the ground with my fist. I'll... I lift my head and wail. I'll murder the man who took him from me. I'll end his life just as he ended Preacher's.

I breathe as deeply as I can, trying to rid myself of the suffocating feelings. I let rage fuel my resolve, and I force myself to stand on my wobbly feet. I start down the dirt path that leads to the center of the estate where the main house and Topa's office are. Hatred seeps into my psyche and drenches it with a malicious-filled insanity as I rush to my target, evading the rest of the guards. I won't have much time before the four at the gate are discovered, so I'll have to be quick and find Topa, and then I'll kill him.
Chapter Five

Enter The Life Closer

9:09 A.M...

The Sanctum...

Within the Chamber...

The Council monitored Pandora's bio-data on the center screen, and they noted changes in her mental state and that her Ultra-Epi had engaged.

"Pandora has entered Topa's estate," Ms. Nona spoke with concern. "Should we stop it? Topa is not part of the experiment."

"No, we will use him as we have used others who stumbled upon our tests," Mr. Morta replied. "The situation could be the catalyst we have been waiting for to take Pandora to the Gamma Phase of its metamorphosis."

Mr. Decuma said, "The project has been a disappointment this past year. Its skills are incredible but–"

"Yes, but Pandora holds back and has not taken a life," Mr. Morta said. "The why is what we have to discover."

"The conditioning has failed," Ms. Nona stated. "We should be working on the Epsilon Phase by now, not worrying about the Gamma."

"No, I think it is more than that. If you will remember even before we took custody of Pandora, it was an enigma. There is nothing wrong with the conditioning. I believe it is Pandora's emotions."

"Its emotions?" Mr. Decuma questioned. He didn't understand the eldest member's reasoning. Mr. Morta held such high expectations for the experiment. It was almost as if he had grown attached and if he had grown attached, it could be a problem. Mr. Morta could lose his indifference if he was not careful.

"Yes," Mr. Morta replied, and then he explained, "Pandora's emotions... though they may be immature... they still influence it. You see, rage and love even from a child... they are both driving forces, and it has not tapped into them."

"Until it met Preacher," Ms. Nona added. "Pandora knew love and now knows rage."

Mr. Morta nodded as he spoke, "Precisely, if we had known how his death would have affected Pandora, we would have killed him long ago to move along its programming."

A female supervisor handed Ms. Nona a report.

Ms. Nona said, "This could be a problem."

"What is it?" Mr. Decuma asked.

"It seems one of the corporations does not like what Topa has been doing lately. A Life Closer has been dispatched to the estate."

"By our corporation?" Mr. Decuma questioned.

"I think not," Mr. Morta answered. "But with an organization as vast as ours, who knows for sure?"

Kimberly's view...

At the northwest corner of Topa's estate, I throw a small J-shaped grappling hook over the wall. The northwest part of the estate has little lighting, so I easily hide in the darkness of the late morning. Murky gray Dry Clouds rumble overhead, warning of a possible Tainted Rainstorm. I'm a native of the Dark Half and thankfully, I don't have to wear a Winnow Mask. I pull my knit mask over my face, make sure it's securely in place, and check over my black outfit. I'm wearing thin gloves, jogging pants, running shoes, a tank top, and a zipped up hooded sweatshirt. I need to keep my identity a secret. Assassination might be legal, but anonymity will keep me from having to face some vengeful family member, lover, friend, or Illicit Closer. I've been lucky so far and no one's ever seen my face when I've been on a Closing. I prefer not to kill anyone who's not part of the Closing. If I do, I'll have to file extra paperwork. Voice hates unnecessary deaths as much as I do, and I don't want to make Voice upset.

I climb the cord to the top of the wall, drop down to the other side, and glance at my watch once I reach the ground. I'll have this Life Closing done within the hour if all goes well, and Topa will make the front cover again but the headline this time will read, "Found Dead."

I toss the thin climbing cord, grappling hook, and black knapsack in the corner and pile some leaves on the items to hide them, and then I check the tactical knife in a sheath strapped to my right calf. I quietly slip by the guards and make my way to his office. In the email Voice sent, the Closing File states Topa will most likely be there. The office is at the end of a long cobblestone path leading from the house. Black cast-iron lamps light the area, small pine trees grow along the path, and hedges line the last twenty feet of the walkway and around the office. I hide in the bushes underneath a window just left of Topa who's sitting. I glance in and see one henchman in a corner and my target busy at his mahogany desk. I place a silencer on a Walther PPK and stand to make my way in and finish this Closing quick and clean, but the front door opens. I duck back into the hedges, and the green-blue bushes rustle with my movement and then through the window, I watch as a second henchman walks into the room. He removes his WM-B and adjusts the mask's strap. Topa counts bundles of money and then places the stacks in a briefcase.

"This is payment for the Illicit Closer we hired to take out that nuisance on Wayfaring Lane," Topa relays as he finishes counting. "That do-gooder won't be hindering our sales of Sunna Snapps anymore."

"Why the cash, boss?" the second henchman questions. "Why not credits?"

"This cash can't be traced to me. Credits could be."

"Makes sense, boss."

I can't believe he hired an illegal assassin. I think people are really stupid when they take a chance by hiring someone who doesn't belong to the Assassins Guild. If Voice or Thanatos finds out, they'll kill him. I shrug as I decide in the scheme of things it doesn't matter now. Topa's Closing is today. What more can they do to him?

Topa shuts the briefcase and hands it to his second henchman as he orders him, "Also tell our contact at the Valhalla Corporation we'll be doubling our next order of Sunna Snapps now that business will be getting back to normal."

"Understood," the second henchman replies, then puts his Winnow Mask back on, takes the briefcase, and leaves through the back door.

Topa turns to the first henchman and tells him, "Ready my car. We're going into the Norse Sector."

The first henchman turns towards the window, so I duck down and after a few moments, I hear the door open and shut. I glance in the window, seeing that the muscle has left, so I again start to leave my hiding place. I can kill Topa before anyone comes back and be down with this Closing. I need to get some rest. I'm still tired from my last assignment. The front door opens before I leave my hiding spot, so I quickly duck back into the bushes. For Ares' sake! What's up with my luck today? All I want to do is complete this Life Closing and go home!

Katharine's view...

I enter and find Topa alone. His office smells of polished wood and has an old feel to it. Black and white photos of distinguished men who look related to him line the walls. I turn away from them. I can't let myself be distracted. I have to focus on my grim objective, and it's now or never. I have to eliminate the man who took Preacher from me. My gunhand shakes with indecision as it leans against my leg. I try to convince myself even my broken heart believes I have to commit this atrocious deed to atone for my failure to save Preacher.

Kimberly's view...

I peek through the window as I keep myself hidden, trying to figure out who the woman is. She could be a second Closer. I glower, a little irritated and duck back down. Did Voice send in backup? I never needed it. I think about it. I never needed it before Moscow. I cautiously glance through the window and study the woman, and she doesn't have the look of a Closer. Maybe she's a bodyguard.

Topa glances up when the door first squeaks open. He stares at her for a long time before he questions her, "How did you get in here?"

I see him press a button under his desk, triggering a silent alarm.

The woman raises her gun, aims it at him, and yells, "You must pay for what you did to Preacher!"

Maybe my luck has changed. Maybe this woman will take out Topa, and I can get out of here. I won't receive the full payment for this assignment if she does the deed for me but right now I don't care. I just want to go back to bed and sleep away this dreadful past week until it's far from my mind.

End Kimberly's view...

Within the Chamber...

Ms. Nona reported, "Argus is on the estate and has found Pandora in Topa's office. It is about to kill him."

"Good... Good... The Gamma Phase will finally be achieved when Pandora takes a life," Mr. Morta spoke as he beamed with pride, and then he inquired, "Where is the Closer?"

"Holding outside of the office," Mr. Decuma answered. "The Closer will not move with the unknown woman in the room."

"Finally..." Mr. Morta began as he considered all the hard work they had devoted to Pandora. "I have had such high hopes for this particular project. We have waited to achieve this pinnacle for one long year." With elated breath, he added, "Now we will witness Pandora's transformation as it completes the Gamma Phase."

Preacher

Etymology, history and usage of the word puck...

Puck originally was the word for a mythological fairy or mischievous natured sprite. The meaning later expanded and emerged in slang around 300 B.D.C. in lands owned by the Druid Corporation. It referred to one's disdain for something. The word has taken on other meanings over the centuries and has been used cross-sectorally.

One year before Kat entered Topa's estate...

31 A.D.C...

October 26...

Monday...

3:15 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Old Business Vicinage...

Flickering street lights and neon signs cast a somber glow on Wayfaring Lane; it was a place where society's outcasts drudged out an existence. Many people lined the street, selling Transgenic Vegetables, used clothes, and canned food, and there were even people who dealt in flesh, Sunna Snapps, and/or stolen water rations. Huddled in a corner down a dead end alley, three dirty thin junkies shared a needle of Sunna Snapps. A man and a woman already shot up and were oblivious to their surroundings while the third rolled up his sleeve, injected the yellow liquid into his arm, and leaned back against the brick wall. His body warmed in the cool air as if he lay on a sunny beach and snaps of light appeared like he was seeing stars but larger and brighter.

A six-wheeled robotic Street Sanitizer the size of a small car rumbled down the potholed road past the alley. Nozzles in the front of it and the middle sprayed a cleaning agent. Scrubbing brushes just behind each set of nozzles scoured an oily residue on the road left behind by the Tainted Rain. A vacuum in the back sucked up the dark liquid and stored the polluted water in a large tank. The small vehicles kept the highways and byways from becoming cesspools and without the cleaners, Noir would come to a halt. The loud Street Sanitizer rumbled on, passing a Grub Filter sitting on the sidewalk against a building. The eight-foot square metal beast also known as a Grubby pulled in air, filtering out the petroleum-based pollutants caused by Dry Clouds. Usually, four Grubbies covered each block but this was Wayfaring Lane, they were lucky to have the one.

Evening approached as more people filled the street. Some wore Winnow Masks, marking them as recent immigrants to the Dark Half of the planet, but most of them didn't wear the air filters, having lived in Noir long enough for their lungs to become accustomed to the pollutants.

Katharine's view...

I stumble onto Wayfaring Lane, fleeing the Un-Man with the knife. The Un-Man attacked me four days ago and since then, it's been chasing me in a sadistic cat and mouse game. It came so close to killing me a couple of times already. I lost it a few hours ago and thankfully, it hasn't found me again. I know this because the Un-Man would have triggered my bio-mecha warning like the Un-Men had done when they first entered Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse. These abilities that I have, they're unnatural. I can sense the presence of bio-mechas but more than that... the last day or two I've been having these flashes like I understand how they're thinking and working. It's so scary. I also seem to see my own body like I'm on the outside looking in. It's so weird and freaky. There has to be someone out there who can help me. I just need to find them, and then maybe they can put this nightmare to an end.

I pause at an alley wall and lean on it as I catch my breath. I can't stop running till I find a place that's safe, so I push through my exhaustion and run on. Blood cakes my left shoulder where one of the Un-Men's bullets grazed me, and dried plasma crusts the knife cut on my left forearm. Since waking at Etna, I've only eaten what food I scrounged from trash cans and slept only minutes at a time. Weariness and mental anguish are taking their toll on me. I think I'm near my breaking point.

Tired to the bone, I sprint down an obscure alley, trying to stay on my feet and not fall. I look over my shoulder as I splatter through puddles of Tainted Rain. The black water that smells of petroleum speckles my t-shirt and pants. I turn a corner and run into a man who's wearing a black trench coat. I stumble back and nearly fall, but I manage to put my hand out to the alley wall and steady myself. He says nothing to me only eyes me curiously like he's debating the best way to kill me so with a trembling hand, I raise my gun and aim at him.

"There's no need for that," he tells me. "I'm Argus and my job isn't to harm you."

Argus' view...

Pandora doesn't seem to understand me, and I notice its face shows fatigue and its hazel eyes, that mimic a human's, have the look of a lost puppy. Maybe it's too tired to understand me. The Factory has yet to recall or capture its wayward Un-Man. I don't believe Pandora has had any rest and even if it's a project, I don't know how long it can maintain such an unrelenting pace. It takes two steps back from me as if to bolt, so I quickly tell Pandora what I've been ordered to tell it.

"My employers the Council have some information for you," I say, taking a step forward, push the gun down to its side, and note Pandora's wounds, including the large bruise on its forehead. I tell it, "The Un-Man that the Factory sent after you, the Rogue, is no ordinary bio-mecha. There's a glitch in its programming. The Council wants you to be extra careful with it, and they also want me to inform you that the only way to defeat the Rogue is to reach the Delta Phase of your metamorphosis."

Katharine's view...

I have no clue what he's talking about, so I divert my eyes from his intense gaze, and I look at the sidewalk as if I'll find answers there. The world I've been thrust into is scary and confusing like a dark forest to a lost orphaned girl. All I want is for someone to help me. I smooth my hand over the stubble of my shaven head, trying to wrap my mind around what's happening to me. If I don't want to remain ignorant, I need to speak.

"You said the Council..." I begin. "I've heard that name before. Who are they?"

Argus starts to leave, but I desperately grab his wrist and plead with him, "Please tell me. You must at least know me. Please, tell me what my name is."

"You don't know your name?" he says as if he's surprised. "You're the Pandora Project." He grabs my other arm, turns my hand over, and places a 9 mm magazine in my palm. "If you want to survive the tests, never run out of ammo."

Argus turns to head down the street, and I can't let him go. He must be the someone I've been searching for to help me, so I shout after him, "Please! Don't leave me. Tell me what my real name is! There must be more... I must be more than a project."

He pauses as if my pleas have reached him, and he says, "I'm not here to kill you, but I'm also not here to help you. You're on your own. Though, it's regrettable you have no memory." He turns and looks at me with concern like one would peer at a crying infant, and then he speaks, "It must be very frightening not knowing why bio-mechas are trying to kill you." His expression softens for a split second and in that instance, I hope I see my knight, but then I realize the look he's giving me is one of pity as he informs me, "It's simple. You're being tested, and they're being tested." A black sedan pulls up, and he gets in as he tells me, "Know one thing... stay alive."

The car drives away from me as I stare at it unable to move. I don't want to be on my own. I want someone to help me and to make me feel safe like those arms... I see a flash or more like I feel warm gentle arms embracing me and cuddling me. I have felt safe before. I've felt protected from the monsters of this world.

I look at the car that's nearly out of sight, and the weight of what he told me hits me hard as if I've just received a death sentence from a judge. I can barely move my legs that feel like giant sandbags, so I slowly move over to a building, turn before fear and exhaustion causes my knees to buckle, slide down its rough wall, and land in a defeated lump.

"Someone help me," I whisper as I put my head on my knees, wrap my arms around myself, and rock back and forth. "Please, help me."

In the sedan...

Argus' view...

I remove my cell phone and make a call as the vehicle turns off of Wayfaring Lane.

"I have some new information for the Council," I start and wait until I'm patched in. "Pandora claims to have no memory of who it is and there does appear to be a wound on its forehead." I pause, listening to their reply. "Understood. I'll continue my surveillance and tell Pandora nothing about itself. As the Council wishes, so it will be done."

Back down the street...

Katharine's view...

I clench my gun, trying to understand things that seem unreal like I've been flung into a world that's not my own. Argus told me the Un-Men were sent by the Factory, that the one I can't destroy is called the Rogue, and that it's no ordinary Un-Man. The Factory knows who I am, but I don't know who or what they are. I also don't understand why they want me dead.

The coldness of the sidewalk chills my body, so I hug myself tighter as I continue to rock back and forth. I find little comfort in my own embrace and loneliness creeps up behind me and threatens to snatch what little hope I have left. Minutes go by, and I know what I'm doing won't help me and if I want to get out of this messed up situation, I have to focus on discovering the truth.

Argus said the Council wants me to be extra careful with the Rogue. It sounds like the Council's on my side but for some reason, I don't think that's true. I have to figure out what the Delta Phase is and what I'm supposed to turn into. They talk like I'm some sort of butterfly. I still don't understand why these horrible things are happening to me. Argus calls them tests and that I'm being tested and that the Un-Men are being tested, but what's the purpose of it all?

I lift my head and stare at the Dry Clouds in the dark sky. I need to get up and keep going, but I'm so exhausted. I'm tired of running and consider letting the Un-Man capture me, but then I decide against it. I'm more afraid of capture and what cruel things they'll do to me, so I slowly start to rise when panic sets in as my heart sounds the bio-mecha warning.

Ultra-Epi rushes through my veins as I stand and frantically look across the street and search for the relentless hunting machine. I eject the old empty magazine and with a shaky hand, I place in the new one. The e-field of my body alters as my eyes shimmer with blue electricity. Somehow, I know that the light coming from my eyes is called Ultra-Epi Light Emissions or Ult L-E.

The Rogue walks through a dark cluttered street lit by neon signs and street lights. The Type Four Model of Un-Man has short, brown, wavy hair and a pale chiseled face. Black smudges from Tainted Rain cover its brown suit. The Rogue passes three hookers and their pimp. I can sense that it knows I'm here, so I slowly walk away trying to blend into the background. I'm afraid if I run, the Rogue will spot me right away. I snailishly escape, but I can't seem to get the Rogue out of my mind. I see things that it must be seeing.

"Hey there, big guy," one of the women says, sizing up what she must think is a man. "Looking to party?"

"Yeah," another says. "Mr. Shades. What ya hiding behind those glasses anyway? Did yer old woman black yer eye?"

The Rogue turns to the second hooker, and its polarized spectacles reflect an XXX red neon sign as it questions, "Old woman? No, no old woman but if we party, I will show you what is behind them," the Rogue speaks as it removes its large knife, grabs her wrist as the other two women run off screaming, and then it says, "Let us party."

The hooker tries to pull away from the maniac waving a knife.

"Hey, none of that kinky stuff till we discuss a price," the pimp demands as he walks to them.

The Rogue punches him in the abdomen as it tells him, "Mind your manners. I am talking to the lady here."

The pimp grabs his stomach as he snarls, and then he pulls a small gun and threatens, "It isn't how things work here."

"How things work?" it questions and then still hanging on to the woman, the Rogue grabs the man's hand that holds the weapon, twists it, and breaks his wrist. It states, "This is how things work in my world."

The pimp cries out, drops the gun, collapses to his knees, and holds his wrist, screaming, "My hand! You broke my hand! Pucker!" he curses. "You're going to pay for this!"

I'm still fleeing in the other direction but stop as the pimp cries out again. I glance at my gun. Everything within me screams for me to escape while I have the chance, but one small voice tells me save them. The flow of the e-field increases, and the blue stage of the Ult L-E glows brighter as the voice grows louder in my thoughts. Save them.

The hooker, horrified by what she witnessed, tries to pull away and bolt but the maniac yanks her to him.

"Do not be rude and leave before the party has started," it says as it pulls her close and whispers, "Pandora. We have to wait for Pandora."

"Pandora? Sick mother-pucker! You can get yer freak on with someone else. Ya creep! Let me go, you pucker!" The woman screams, pulling against his hold and yells, "Let me go!"

I approach them, raise my gun, and aim for its forehead as the orange color of its dot-light changes to a fiery crimson. There's something different about this Un-Man, something deep within it that I can see and yet I can't see.

A wicked grin slithers across the Rogue's pale face as I tell it, "You can release her. I'm here."

"Ahh... Pandora..." The Rogue pauses, and then it asks, "Let her go? Why would I do that?"

"I'm your target. Why do you need to hurt anyone else?"

"Yours is a valid question," the Rogue states as it twirls the hooker around, wraps her up in its arms, and places its blade against her throat. The hooker whimpers as it continues, "I enjoy it, but bio-mechas are not supposed to feel anything so that makes me something special, does it not? I think that is why my creators are afraid of me and why they want to destroy me." The Rogue scans me, noting my fear and exhaustion. It also notices my eyes' bluish afterglow in the darkness of the day and that the light's not normal for a human. The Rogue tells me, "It is also the reason you want me dead."

"I don't want you dead. I just want you to stop hunting me!"

"I cannot," the Rogue replies as it examines every feature and minute scar on my face. It's creeping me out as it imprints them all to memory. "I am still a machine and at least for now, I cannot escape my programming."

I hate depending on the gun for my survival and try to talk my way out by saying, "Maybe your creators are afraid of you, not because you have feelings but because you have the potential to disobey your programming."

"You mean like you," the Rogue accuses me, and then it laughs. "You have done well so far to go against your own programming but no... For me, it is my potential for evil that they fear. I am sure of it." It cuts a tiny slit in the hooker's neck and makes her whimper louder as it asks, "But what would a machine know of evil? Am I not the product of my creators' hardware and software or was some other thing added to me that makes me different from the other bio-mechas?"

"I don't know. I only know you're hurting that woman," I answer as I start to pull the trigger.

The Rogue ducks behind the hooker so I have no shot as it demands, "Drop your gun or I will slit her throat. Do it!"

It cuts deeper into her neck, so I give in.

"Okay! Okay!" I utter as I place the gun on the sidewalk, making myself vulnerable to its malicious attacks. "Just don't hurt her!"

"Excellent," the Rogue speaks as it smirks and in that instance, I can't read it. It's like the Un-Man's blocking my ability to get inside its head.

"Now what?" I ask, not sure what my next move should be.

Panic sets in as I see the Rogue's grin spread out in a devious smirk, and it answers me, "Now you watch me kill her!"

Before I have a chance to utter no, a man comes up behind the Rogue.

"Hey!" the man shouts.

The Rogue turns as the man swings a metal bat, striking it in the head, and the Rogue stumbles back and releases the hooker. The attack knocks its polarized spectacles off, and the damaged frames fall to the street. I grab my gun and fire twice, but the Rogue with its lightning reflexes evades the bullets, and then it backhands the man, knocking him to the ground. It turns on me and freezes, but it's not looking at me, so I turn around and see a black van with tinted windows speeding our way.

The Rogue turns and flees down an alley, shouting as it runs, "It seems the Factory has tracked me down. We will finish this another day, Pandora!"

The hooker rushes over to the pimp and questions him, "Are ya all right? Oh, yer hand. Let's get ya to a hospital."

The black van speeds by us in their pursuit of the Rogue as the pounding of my heart lessens. I set the safety and tuck my gun in the back waistband of my pants. I wait till my irises lose their radiance before I walk over to the man. He rubs his bloodied mouth and looks up at me.

I offer my hand as I say, "Thanks."

"No problem," he tells me, grabs my wrist, pulls himself up, and then introduces himself, "The name's Preacher." He picks up his metal bat and glances into the alley the Rogue ran through. "That thing was no man. What was it?"

"They're called bio-mechas and that model is an Un-Man."

"They? There are more of them?"

"Yes, there are more," I answer and then mutter, "There are so many more."

"No kidding." He walks up to a stoop and picks up a white Bible as he comments, "Noir's getting wilder every day."

I move to the Rogue's broken polarized spectacles, pick them up, and peer through them. The lenses are mostly intact and intermediately fizz and crackle between green lettered readouts across tiny square screens. The polarized spectacles do more than hide their eyes, they relay tactical data from the Factory and from each other. I drop them to the sidewalk and crush them with my shoe in case the polarized spectacles carry tracking beacons, and then I start across the street.

"Wait! Where are you going?" Preacher asks as he jogs after me.

I turn as he places his hand on my shoulder, and then I repeat, "Where..? I... I don't know."

"Well, you look like you could use a meal and clean up a bit." He motions to the dried blood on my forearm and shoulder and adds, "And some first aid."

I stare at the thin scraggly man with shoulder-length stringy black hair. Preacher wears a worn navy blue t-shirt and broken black rim glasses taped in the front. His blue-gray eyes and pearly white smile catch my attention, and they make me feel safe and welcomed. Have I finally found my knight? I notice he's staring at me, and I blush.

Preacher waves his free hand like I've been looking at him as if he's some sort of weirdo, and he tells me, "I'm not being perverted or anything. I run a shelter, the Kitchen. It seems to me you've been on the go for a while, so I thought you might be hungry."

I nod as my stomach growls. I'd cry if I had the strength to. I think I've found my safe place.

"You aren't much for talking are you?"

I shake my head.

"Shy. That's okay. Come on. I believe grilled cheese and tomato soup are on the menu tonight."

Farewell My Friend

Tuesday...

7:30 P.M...

Katharine's view...

A helicopter flies over Wayfaring Lane just beneath the looming Dry Clouds, and a gust sweeps up an old newspaper, tumbling it down the potholed blacktop as me and Preacher sit on a stoop in front of the Kitchen. We watch the people in the neighborhood as he tries to comfort me in his own way. Preacher once told me he's never seen someone so lonely or lost. He understands that we're from two different worlds but... Preacher still wants to understand me as desperately as I want to be apart of his life. What frustrates me the most is that my past, that keeps eluding me, just won't let it happen.

He glances at me and must notice how depressed I am. He rests his rough calloused hand on mine, and we sit there in silence for about twenty minutes. I try not to be so distant, and it's still hard for me to connect. There have been so few people who have been good to me, and he's top on the list.

"What are you thinking?" he asks me.

I start to answer but instead, I stare up at the ever-present nemesis of Noir. I've always wondered how something so fluffy and so soft looking could beat back the might of the sun; it's only another question on my endless list of questions. Since awakening in Etna Toys, I've discovered nothing about my past or why I'm hunted.

I glance at his hand. Usually, his touch makes me feel better but not today. Only answers will fill the hollowness of my soul, so I gently pull my hand away from his and rest my hand on my lap. I'll do almost anything to find some scrap of my past. If I can just find out if Kat's my real name and where I come from, I'll be happy. It hurts too much not knowing, and I don't think Preacher understands. He doesn't understand how frustrating it is and that in itself hurts. I'm alone in a void of uncertainty and because of that, I'm a stranger in our relationship, but I don't know why I haven't shared this with him. I guess I'm afraid he won't understand, and I don't think I can take it. I can't be alone in something else, so I haven't said anything.

When I don't answer his question, Preacher looks down at his Bible he always carries as if he's unsure of what to say. It's like he's searching for words that will comfort me, and then he finally tells me, "Katharine, don't you know there's more to this life than what you can see?"

I focus on the book he holds, and then I reply, "You have told me but still, there's something within me that wants to discover who I am." I stare at my worn shoes and speak softly, "And yet, there's this part that fears what I might discover."

I turn to him, hoping to find a sympathetic heart and a look of understanding to the uneasiness that haunts me, but what I find is Preacher peering at the street as his attention's drawn to a group of kids playing. He smiles... and I wonder if it's because he knows even in Wayfaring Lane children can find time to be children. When he doesn't notice my searching gaze, I turn my attention to the kids. I'd usually go play with them but today... so much is on my mind.

I frown, turn my attention back to my shoes, and then say almost in a whisper, "What if I'm a bad person? What if I've done terrible things?"

"We've all done bad things," he answers as he finally turns to me.

I lift my gaze back to him, searching once again for the sympathetic heart and the look of understanding, but all I see is that his expression saddens as if his statement was a reflection of his own life. I notice a red VX Corvette with the license plate FromAshes drives by with a blonde lady at the wheel before I once again divert my eyes to my worn shoes.

"I feel like I should be searching for something," I tell him, not sure he's really listening. I grab my backpack that's sitting beside me, unzip it, remove the worn note, business card, and the music box that was with me at Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse, and then I say, "I know these are clues to my past, but how do they fit?"

"Our Gracious Lord has a plan for you. I know it and in due time, he'll show it to you. You only need to be patient."

His words don't help me, and I wonder again if he's really listening as I say, "That's all I seem to have, but even my patience is running out."

Preacher grins and his blue-gray eyes and pearly white smile catch my attention once again. His warm expression makes me feel safe and gives me some hope; it gives me hope that my search won't be in vain. I no longer fear he's not listening to me as I lean over and lie my head on his shoulder. If only my life was always this peaceful, then...

Tuesday...

10:11 P.M...

The day before Kat arrived at Topa's estate...

Katharine's view...

A car burns and then explodes, sending fiery shrapnel in all directions. Bullet holes litter the buildings, and the citizens of Wayfaring Lane run screaming for their lives as I return from meeting an informant who never showed.

An old bag lady holding a golf club runs up to me out of breath and exclaims, "Someone shot Preacher!"

"What?" I utter, and then I demand, "Where is he?"

The bag lady points with the golf club as tears stream down her wrinkled face.

I take off running in that direction as anxiety presses against my chest. A million things run through my mind as I hurry toward the Kitchen, screaming, "Preacher! Preacher!!"

I continue running till I spot Argus who's standing at the entrance of an alley with his back to me as he stares at the pavement. I run past him and find Preacher lying in a pool of blood. He's been shot several times in the chest. I freeze, paralyzed with dread, and I stare in disbelief at his lifeless body.

"No," I whimper and take a step forward. "No."

I walk to Preacher and collapse at his side. I fear touching him and discovering the truth as my eyes burn with my cowardice and anguish. He can't be dead. He's not dead. I pick up his hand, and his skin's cold to the touch.

"Preacher," I whisper, looking into his pale face. "Look at me." He doesn't respond to me. "Don't you die on me." I squeeze his hand. "Don't you leave me alone." He still doesn't respond, so I turn to Argus and desperately order, "Hurry! Go get some help!"

Argus doesn't move or say anything, so I turn my attention back to Preacher. I rub his cold hand as if to bring warmth back into it. My mind already knows something that my heart refuses to believe.

"Don't worry," I tell him. "Help will be coming, hang in there. You have to. You can't leave me alone." I lean to him, pleading, "I can't bear my life without you so please... stay with me."

I lean back, looking at the man who was there when I wake screaming in the middle of the night in the shelter, the man who held my hand and stayed by my side for three days when I had been shot, and the man who didn't care that bio-mechas hunted me or that I'm the Pandora Project.

His eyes are closed, and he looks as if he's sleeping. I notice there's something missing about him, not something physical but spiritual. I know it's too late as my heart realizes what my mind has kept from it, and I finally allow myself to believe he's gone.

"Not you!" I scream. "Not you!!" I shake him and cry, "No..!" I cradle his head in my arms and wail to the heavens as I beg him, "Don't leave me! Don't leave me!"

My heart aches, and my eyes swelter with a dry grief as I'm unable to shed a tear. It never tortured me before that I couldn't cry, but now I wonder if it's because I'm something like a bio-mecha who's not capable of expressing grief.

I sit there for minutes, holding Preacher in my arms as his blood saturates my t-shirt, and then I rest my head on his and whisper, "Forgive me, I should have been here. You told me not to go to the meeting and that it might be a trap, but I didn't listen. I had to go. I had to find that scrap." I sniff before continuing, "I should have listened but no... I had to find out if the man knew anything about my past, but he wasn't there. No one was there."

I notice Argus' shadow that's stretches down the alley, and I wonder if the Council's behind this and if they lured me away to kill Preacher in another one of their tests. My sorrow turns to anger as I come to the conclusion that the Council did kill Preacher.

I direct my rage at Argus and demand, "Who did this? Who shot him?"

He doesn't answer me, and he just stands there as the breeze whips his black trench coat as if he's a stoic knight standing guard at a drawbridge. I know he's no knight, knights are gallant and protect the weak. No one can't protect if they only watch.

I snap at him as if yelling at myself for not being there to save the man I love, "I know you saw... You're always watching. Was it the Council? Did they have Preacher killed? Did they have him killed to get at me because I'm not passing their tests? Because I'm not passing something called the Gamma Phase?" I gently lay Preacher down, stand, grab Argus by his coat's collar, and slam him against the alley wall. "You were here, weren't you?" I scream, wild with rage. "You were here and did nothing!" I beat my fist on his chest. "Isn't that right? Tell me! Did you watch them kill him?"

"Yes," Argus answers as he looks down at me, taking my hits as if they're a small part of his penitence. "My job is to watch," he tells me as his expression remains blank. "I'm not to hinder or help. My job is to–"

"Shut up! I hate you!" I snap at him as I drop my fist, lean my head on his chest, and whisper, "I hate you."

My words must sting as if I punched him for his body flinches. I lift my face to scream at him again, and the next thing that happens surprises me. His eyes are watering. Argus never showed any emotion before and for the longest time, I thought he was an Un-Man.

Argus lifts his hand as if he's going to stroke my head and soothe my sorrow, but then he drops his hand. He had told me once that he developed something his training should have prevented. He developed feelings for me. A part of me wants to reach out to him and find some comfort with him, but I can't. He's part of the Council... He's part of those who did this to Preacher.

I deeply heave as sorrow and anguish drown me, and then I demand, "Tell me. Tell me who murdered Preacher. Was it the Council or the Factory?"

He doesn't answer me and that makes me more infuriated with myself than with him. It's not Argus' job to protect Preacher. I should have been here. I should have listened to Preacher's advice, so I direct all my anger at Argus only because he's standing there.

"For once in your life, do something useful! Take a side... Take a stand!" I scream as I die inside. "Be more than an observer!" I look up into his watery blue eyes, looking... no pleading for comfort and whisper, "Kill me." I strike his chest with my fist; it's the only thing I can think to do for no one will wrap their arms around me again. "Help me," I beg as I hit him again. "Just do something!"

I hide my face in his coat, and my body trembles with sorrow and heartache, knowing nothing will bring back Preacher and that I'm all alone.

"Topa," Argus whispers. "Topa ordered the Closing on Preacher. He has an estate on the outskirts of the Hellenistic Sector."

I sniff, pull myself back, and stare at him heartbroken. I stare at him for a long time, and then I slap Argus in the face, and he only looks at me. I tell him with self-loathing thick on my lips, "That's for doing nothing and letting Preacher die."

It was me though... I let Preacher die. I'm the one to blame because I wasn't here. My eyes still burn as I turn my back on Argus and tell him, "I don't ever want to see you again." I walk over to Preacher, take the Bible from his grasp, and head out of Wayfaring Lane as I inform Argus, "You're my shadow no more so don't follow me."

I leave the alley and start on my grim quest. I'll kill Topa. My knight... the one who saved me from my despair is dead, so I go to slay the dragon who murdered him.
Chapter Eight

From The Ashes

Present time...

October 13...

Wednesday...

9:47 A.M...

Katharine's view...

Topa's office feels menacing and reeks of corruption as the men in the photos stare at me. They seem to glare down at me as if I'm the monster in the room, but I ignore their silent accusations as my heart aches so much it makes me ill. Preacher gave me the strength to go on, and he made me feel like a person, not a project. Now I feel empty, alone, and part of some twisted experiment. Topa will pay for killing the only light in my life. I'll snuff out his flame as he had Preacher's life extinguished.

My gun weighs heavy in my hand, and I don't know how much longer I can hold it up. Sorrow overwhelms me as I aim for Topa's forehead. I have to make the pain go away, and this is the only way I can think of to make it stop hurting. Preacher's presence is here with me as I cradle his book, clenching it as I will him to come back to me. I know he won't be coming back and as I grip the gun, I also know Preacher would want me to do this. He's urging me on. He's telling me to take the shot and kill the dragon but... I feel like I'm missing something. I feel as though I'm about to betray him in some way.

Topa must notice my hesitation for he questions me, "Have you ever killed someone?"

I don't answer as I start to press my finger against the trigger. Topa's death will be like the others. He will die just like the Un-Men. I'll squeeze the trigger, and the bullet will penetrate his forehead and enter his automaton brain. No... That's not right. I can't be naïve about it. This killing will be different. Topa's flesh and not a bio-mecha, so I have to be honest with myself. I waver a little. I'll be taking a life, and it's the one thing I fought so hard not to do, but he killed Preacher so it has to change things. Preacher was my friend, and I lov...

I let the last word fade from my mind. I have no right to claim that type of relationship, not when I couldn't admit that simple word to Preacher. I pause in my thoughts as grief seizes me again, and I scream, "Nothing will bring Preacher back, so you have to die!"

"It isn't all that easy taking someone's life," Topa tells me as he reaches down, and I hear him open a desk drawer which probably has a gun in it. "Can you do it?"

"I will kill you! You murdered Preacher! You should die!"

My arm shakes as rage and grief shrieks at me to pull the trigger but something holds me back.

He must see the hatred in my eyes for Topa becomes a little nervous, but then two of his men enter from the door behind me, and he regains his confidence and questions, "Preacher? Oh... You mean the do-gooder causing me problems on Wayfaring Lane. You say he's dead?"

"You know he's dead! You ordered the Closing!"

"Maybe I did."

"I know you did!" I scream as the pain in my chest worsens, and I can no longer withstand the sorrow wanting to consume me. My resolve to kill Topa vanishes as I wish with all my being that Preacher would wrap his arms around me and tell me everything will be all right. I know that will never happen, and my gun arm drops slightly, and I no longer aim at Topa. I pull into myself, and once again aim the blame at my own feet. I should have never left Preacher's side. He's dead because I wasn't there to save him.

"You're here to do what?" he asks. "Kill me?" Topa looks me over and mocks my resolve, "You don't have it in you."

I can't let him dictate my revenge, so I lift my gun as if this action alone will give me the courage, but something within me tells me courage's not what I'm missing. I ignore the voice and tell him, "You should die for what you did but before I kill you, I have to know. Do you work for the Council or the Factory? Which one of them had Preacher killed?"

"The Factory I've never heard of but the Council..." He studies me more closely as if seeing me in a darker shade than before, and then he questions me, "What would someone like you know of them?"

"You didn't answer my question! Who do you work for?"

Topa laughs at me again as if I should know the answer, and then he tells me, "I work for no one but myself."

I don't believe him, and I let him know by saying, "You can refuse to answer me, but I know better." I scream, "You have to die because you killed him!"

I aim the gun again as I wrestle with the trigger and my emotions. I don't understand... I shouldn't be hesitating. I should shoot Topa and finish it! At that moment, I once again feel the worn leather of the book, reminding me of Preacher and this time, I hear his true voice. I drop my gun arm and sob as I finally understand. Preacher wouldn't want me to take revenge. It's wrong. He wouldn't want me to kill someone because of him, and he would never tell me to take the shot.

Outside the window...

Kimberly's view...

I watch the entire scene unfold with that woman. Idiot! You're weak and spineless. I grip the PPK. Kill him. Take your revenge. I wouldn't hesitate if someone had killed someone precious to me.

End Kimberly's view...

Within the Sanctum...

An alarm sounded. The Chamber Analysts and supervisors fell silent as they tensed, fearing the reaction of the Council. On the center screen in large red letters blinked "Third Evolvement Failure".

"NO!" Mr. Decuma shouted as he slammed his fist on the table, joggling his laptop. "Pandora failed! Why can it not take a life? Pandora has no problems dealing with the Un-Men, but it has refused to kill every human assassin we sent after it."

"The Un-Men are bio-mechas. They are not alive," Ms. Nona stated. "Pandora knows the difference even with the conditioning."

"Should we terminate the project? "Mr. Decuma asked.

An analyst turned off the alarm as Mr. Morta replied, "No, not just yet. All we need to do is find a sufficient catalyst."

"What about the tests?" Ms. Nona questioned.

Mr. Morta ordered, "Call off the bounty on Pandora's head and cancel the Life Closing for now. Pandora could use the rest."

"Agreed. I stated my concerns earlier over its fatigue," Ms. Nona said. "We have been pushing it too hard. Most subjects would have broken by now, and what about the Un-Men? Can we get the Factory to call them off?"

"We can request it, but I doubt they will," Mr. Morta answered. "The Factory feels they have as much of a right to Pandora as we do and most likely, they will continue to test their bio-mechas. We will focus on finding a catalyst for now."

"Agreed," Ms. Nona and Mr. Decuma said in one accord.

Back at Topa's estate...

Katharine's view...

Topa's henchmen quickly grab me from behind, and one of them takes my gun.

"Vengeance is mine, says the Lord," Topa speaks and then chuckles as one of his henchmen grabs the book from me. "I think you should take up a new religion because this one has failed you." He motions to his henchmen and orders, "Take her to the wine cellar and hold her there. I'll be down later to deal with our new guest."

They nod and start to take me outside as Topa closes the drawer to his desk. He stands, walks to a wall safe, and starts to unlock it.

Kimberly's view...

I wait until the two men escort that woman down the path, and then I make my way to the office door. I remove my knit mask right before I turn the knob and go in. Topa's standing in front of a wall safe and turns to me as I enter. I shut the door behind me.

"Now what is it?" Topa asks as if he's irritated with me for disturbing him.

I lock the door as I state, "I usually don't let anyone see me." The Mark doesn't know the reason for my arrival but he soon will, and I take a bit of wicked pleasure from that fact as I tell him, "But you're a special case."

"I'm going to have to do something about my security." His expression changes to one of perverted interest as he ogles my body and that only upsets me more, and then he states, "I suppose you're also one of Preacher's friends." He moves to the side of his desk and pulls out his chair but doesn't sit as he continues, "Perhaps you're a lady of the evening who can't live without her daily confessions?"

The man's oozing with grime, and it's like he's slinging it at me, so I sneer as I move to the middle of the office and order him, "Keep your hands where I can see them. I don't need you tripping any silent alarm and as for my profession–" I throw my business card on his mahogany desk as I state, "–this should answer that."

Topa glances down at it and then questions, "What's this? A firebird?" He recognizes the emblem and sits in his chair as if someone shoved him down into it. "No... You can't be." He peers up and panics. "Puck! You're the Phoenix?" He stands, searching for a place to run. "You're a Closer! Don't kill me! I'll pay you anything! I can give you credits or–" Topa motions to his safe as he states, "–I have cash."

"Hades... You really disgust me. Why is it I always hear the same old thing from you Marks? Do you really think you can buy off a Closer? Well, you can't." I clear my throat and then state, "Samuel R. Topa, the Valhalla Corporation has decided they no longer want to do business with you. They're tired of losing their shipments of Sunna Snapps so under the Life Closer Clause of your contract with Valhalla, I am authorized by the Assassin's League to terminate your life."

"But why kill me?"

"I'm only guessing, but it sounds like the narcotic Sunna Snapps hasn't been approved for use, but you're selling it anyway for the corporation. A kind of clinical street trial, but the participants don't know they're guinea pigs. You messed up when you lost a few of the shipments," I reply as I aim. "The Valhalla Corporation is now tying up loose ends and using the pretense of your contract to do it." I shoot twice and smoke rolls from the silencer and with no emotion, I add, "You know... just business."

Gray matter splatters the wall as Topa falls back in his chair and blankly stares at the ceiling.

For once, someone got what they deserved. For Ares' sake! To think this grimy guy had a preacher killed and used an Illicit Closer to do the job. Did he really think the Assassins Guild wouldn't find out? I glance at the black and white photos on his wall. I know people like us are going to Tartarus, but you had to provoke whatever god you believe in to send you there a little early.

I pull my knit mask back on and head out the front door. I want to leave the estate as soon as possible and forget about this horrible week. I really need to take a shower now.
Chapter Nine

The Un-Men Arrive

Points of interest...

Corporations had to develop alternatives for those addicted to nicotine since tobacco plants were nearly wiped out the first few months after the Dry Clouds appeared. The first year of the Dry Clouds (Zero Year), tobacco farms were started on the Light Side of the planet. Twenty-eight years ago, the Corporate Senate decided that crops planted on the Light Side had to produce food, so NicPhake and other synthetics were created. The idea was to wean people off of smoking altogether. The synthetic tobacco proved to be as addictive, and the secondhand smoke from NicPhake caused blindness in some infants. NicPhake was then regulated and could only be acquired with a prescription.

10:12 A.M...

Four black Chrysler 3000s drove across the road leading to Topa's estate. The human drivers parked, turned the headlights off, plunging the area back into darkness, and then the passenger and the two back doors opened. Three Un-Men got out of each car, and the vehicles rocked back and forth as the Un-Men exited. They moved to the back of their vehicles as the drivers popped the trunks, and an Un-Man of each group removed Uzis from the back and armed their brethren and once they were armed, their Input Sensor blinked three times as they received their orders from the Factory.

They uttered, "Setting programming to Infiltration Mode. Eliminate any obstructions to primary Seek and Destroy Program."

The dozen Un-Men gathered in front of the lead vehicle and looked at the north gate that was about a hundred feet down the wall from them. They synchronized to determine the best entry point and relayed their findings to the Factory.

Five armed men stood guard within the gate. The guards noticed them when they pulled up and readied themselves to engage the armed intruders and if they had to, the men would shoot on sight.

In unison, the Un-Men nodded their understanding of the Factory's orders. They slung the Uzi over their shoulder and started for the wall directly in front of them as the drivers drove the vehicles away. The Un-Men climbed over the fifteen-foot wall by stabbing their fingers into the brick. Each thrust of a hand into the mortar and clay sounded like a boot crunching across the snow; it sounded like an army marching across the white powder as they all scaled the wall.

"The intruders climbed over!" a man at the gate yelled.

"Quick, radio in backup!" another man yelled through his WM-B.

The five guards opened fire on the intruders, and bullets riddled the dozen bodies, filling their business suits with holes. The Un-Men remained standing, staring ahead. The guards ceased fire and glanced at one another, seeing that the intruders were still alive.

The Un-Men turned their heads in an eerily co-occurrence and looked at the guards.

"Obstacle encountered," they stated as they assessed the obstruction.

Two of them lifted their Uzi, aimed, and shot the men, and the men's bodies jerked as the wave of bullets bombarded them. The Un-Men ceased, and the men collapsed to the ground. The two Un-Men scanned the bodies and determined the men's life signs had ceased.

"Obstacle eliminated," a Team Leader stated. "Setting programming to Seek and Destroy. We will track down Pandora and eliminate her."

They headed into the heart of the estate in four groups of three as they all stated, "Pandora will not escape us this time."

Earlier at Topa's house...

The two henchmen shoved Kat down the stairs of the cellar and followed after her as the wooden steps creaked with their weight and once they reached the bottom, one of them ordered, "Warner, frisk her."

Warner did and took the music box, business card, and the note from her pant's pocket and set them on a table. He laid the white book and her gun there after he had ejected the gun's magazine and cleared the weapon's chamber. The other henchman motioned with his gun to a chair for her to sit, and she complied. Racks of wine filled the cool dusty room, and a rat scurried across the concrete floor in the back.

One of the henchmen grabbed her chin, lifted it up, examined her face, and said, "You aren't much to look at, are ya?"

Katharine's view...

I don't answer him, there's no point, there's no point to anything. The walk from Topa's office allowed me time to think. I was wrong before... Preacher might not have wanted me to take revenge, but I should have. I should have ended Topa as he so callously snuffed out the only light in my world. I had Topa in my sights, and I couldn't pull the trigger. It was my duty, and I shouldn't have listened to my heart. I failed, so I must concede that this is my fate for not killing Topa. I deserve far worse for not saving Preacher.

The henchman releases my chin and joins the other man at the square table. They both remove their WM-B and breathe in the room's filtered air.

I wipe my hands over my face as I regret allowing a sense of right and wrong stop me. I remember Preacher and the more I think about him, the more I think about how I failed to save him and how I fail to do what I had come to do.

"What do you think Topa will do to her, Muggs?" Warner asks.

"Don't know," Muggs replies as he shrugs. "Slap her around I guess. What does he usually do with women?"

Warner picks up the music box, opens it, and Unfinished Melody plays as I relax in the chair and my eyelids droop. My sorrow and pain vanish with the melody as it lulls me into an oblivious euphoria. Nothing matters when I exist in this state, not even the death of Preacher.

"Hey, she's falling asleep." Muggs stands, kicks my chair, and orders, "Stay awake!" He glances at the book and adds, "Maybe use this time to pray or don't you know you're going to die?"

Entranced by the melody, I ignore Muggs and listen as if I'm a youngster and the music box is the Pied Piper of Hamelin. I'll happily follow the bewitching music and vanish from existence. I stay in this euphoric state until Warner closes the lid, ending the melody.

After he does, Warner examines the music box more closely and states, "This ain't no ordinary trinket. It's electronic or something."

"You could pawn it at least," Muggs says. "It is silver."

With the drug-like music gone, my pain and sorrow rush back like a runaway hovertrain. Feeling nothing would be better than this heart pang, so I plead, "Could you please let the melody play?"

"Shut up! You don't get a final request," Warner tells me, then props his feet on the table, and starts rolling a cigarette with synthetic tobacco.

Muggs looks around the cellar as he says, "I've heard a couple of stories of people who've been taken down here. Isn't there another entrance to this place? One that comes up in the middle of the estate? I've heard–"

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I ignore the men as they talk and focus on the cellar door like a prowling tigress about to pounce. Ultra-Epi courses through my blood as the e-field of my body alters. I can see it happen like I'm reviewing a video of myself. My eyes spark with blue voltage and in a calm voice, I say, "They're here."

Warner lights the cigarette and blows white-pink smoke from the side of his mouth. He takes another drag of NicPhake as he ignores my warning. He doesn't even look at me.

"Who's here?" Muggs asks, turns to face me, and gapes, seeing my eyes. Everyone usually reacts in the same way when they see the Ult L-E, but I'm still not used to how they look at me. They look at me like I'm some sort of evil monster. He stands and nearly knocks over his chair as he inquires, "Are you some sort of creature from the underworld?"

"They're here," I repeat. I don't care if the Un-Men find me or not.

Warner becomes notably upset. I don't think he heard his partner's comment, and he yells at me, "Didn't I tell you to shut the puck up?" He stands and lifts his hand to strike me as white-pink ash drops from the cigarette, and then he pauses and asks, "What's wrong with your eyes?"

"There are twelve intruders at the north gate!" a man yells over the intercom of their WM-Bs. "Hades! They've scaled the wall and are inside!"

Warner picks up his mask and listens.

The man on the other end breathes hard as if he's running.

"We're engaging them."

Weapons fire fills the airwaves.

"They must be wearing armor. We're switching to–"

There's a pause.

"Two of them are turning toward us and have lifted their weapons! Take cover!"

The rapid tat-tat of Uzis drowns out the man's screams.

Warner turns to his partner and orders him, "Quick, get on the radio and see what Topa wants us to do."

"Right, I'm on it." He puts his WM-B on and activates the intercom and speaks, "Boss, this is Muggs."

There's no reply.

"Boss, this is Muggs."

There's still no response.

"Can anyone hear me?" Only dead air returns his call, so he turns to Warner and questions, "Now what?"

Warner thinks for a moment and says, "You stay with the woman. I'm going to head to the main house and see–"

Gunfire erupts above ground, drawing their attention.

Muggs looks up to the cellar's small window and utters, "It's outside the house!"

"These intruders move fast," Warner says. "We need to get out of here!"

The door to the cellar burst open, and three Un-Men start down the stairs, aiming their Uzis.

"Target acquired," they state in their monotone voices. "Will now terminate Pandora."

"Hades!" Muggs curses as he and Warner draw their guns.

The men open fire, and the Un-Men continue down the steps unhindered by the metal barrage.

"Puck! Why won't they die?" Warner yells. "What are they?"

I find my resolve to face Topa again, so I run to the table, grab my things, and then turn the table over. I duck behind it and glance at Warner and Muggs, knowing they're doomed and at that point, I don't care. The only thing I care about is that this will give me a second chance at Topa.

"Hey! What are you doing?" Muggs asks as he turns to me, and then a bullet strikes his shoulder, knocking him back.

Warner grabs him, pulls him behind some crates, and continues firing at the three intruders as they reach the bottom of the stairs. "Die already, you puckers!!"

Muggs leans on the crate to support himself and returns fire.

I dash for the rear of the room as bullets spray by me and in the back, I find a door. I turn the knob, but it's locked, so I stand back, fire at the old lock, and kick in the door. I sprint down a tunnel, hearing the two men die as the Un-Men overrun their position. I'm so full of sorrow and grief, it doesn't matter to me if the men die. Hatred fills my heart. They got what they deserved for working for such an evil man. I follow the tunnel to a ladder as bloodlust fuels my manic dash, and I climb to the surface where a manhole opens into a group of apple trees. No Un-Men or guards battle in the immediate area, so I take the time to check over my weapon. My heart slows since the danger's gone for the moment, and the blue Ult L-E fades as the Ultra-Epi dissipates in my blood.

A raven cawing from the branch of an apple tree draws my attention. I peer at the bird as it seems to be searching for something. Maybe the raven has also lost someone dear to him or maybe... I focus on happier thoughts. Maybe the raven is looking for someone who's dear to him so that they might be reunited. I notice the tree. Red fruit litters the branches, and I feel the warrior within me who's in the rages of battle change to a woman who's in mourning. Preacher loved apples. He had one almost every day. I close my eyes and hold the bloody book to my chest. Topa will die this time and nothing will stop me. I rush toward his office, determined to finish him off no matter how grave the sin is.

Smoke from gunfire and small explosions linger in the air as I hurry by several bodies and one Un-Man they managed to disable. Electrical snaps fly from several holes in its head. The humans' red blood and the Un-Man's black oil mix in a small pool, and I feel a smidgen of guilt. Those men wouldn't be dead if the Un-Men weren't hunting me, but the guilt leaves me as hatred returns, drowning the small voice that utters save them. I duck behind a hedge as four men rush past me.

Fright pales their faces as one shouts orders, "We have to pull back from the gates and meet at the armory. We need heavy artillery."

The group of men hurries on. The thought of helping them against the unstoppable monsters never even crosses my mind, too much animosity clouds my thoughts. I step from the hedge, turn to continue to Topa's office, but pause, narrowing my eyes. Another obstacle pops up to block my revenge.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

Ultra-Epi courses through my blood as my eyes produce a cerulean lambency. There are two Un-Men nearing my position. Fear doesn't fill my heart but rage as the warrior's side of me returns, and I grip the gun ready to eliminate all who stand in my way as an Un-Man steps from the side of a building to my left and another steps from a cluster of trees to my right. I've encountered five different models of Un-Men over the past year. The Rogue, they discontinued; it's a Type Four. The one to my left is a Type Two; it's a six-foot-six thin model with dark brown skin and a South African accent. The other one's a Type Five; it's a six-foot large muscular model with a Russian accent.

"Target acquired. I and another unit have cornered the Pandora Project," the dark skinned Type Two or T-2 relays over its I-Link.

"Commencing attack," the T-5 states.

I raise my gun and fire once to my left and once to my right. I'm going to kill Topa. The Un-Men fall to the ground and lie still as downed trees as I rush on. I'm not going to let anyone or anything get in my way!
Chapter Ten

Caught In A Crossfire

Earlier...

Kimberly's view...

At the northwestern corner of Topa's estate, I pull my black knapsack from the pile of leaves I had hidden it in, throw the grappling hook over the wall, and climb the cord to the top. I spot four cars parked by the north gate with twelve men near them who are carrying Uzis. I drop back down into the estate.

Great, just great! Who are those guys?

I whip up on the rope, forcing the grappling hook to fall down, and then I stow it in the knapsack. Gunfire erupts at the north gate as I race for the center of the estate. I'll try to go over the south wall. Gunfire continues as Topa's men shout, some in panic and some as their last cry. I duck inside a tool shed before six men rush past me. Weedwackers, a lawnmower, shelves, axes, and other lawn tools fill the outbuilding. I wait in the dark structure until I hear the men move on into the distance, and then I leave quietly. A man comes running up from the other direction.

"I've spotted an intruder," he shouts over the WM-B's intercom.

Another man joins him before I fire four times, hitting the first man twice in the stomach, and he falls, shrieking as blood pours from his abdomen. The other two bullets hit the second man in the shoulder and chest. The first man's shrieks alert three more to my position before he dies. I shoot one in the face before the second guard tackles me, and we struggle for my gun until a shot discharges. I moan and roll the dead man off of me, and by then, the third guard has his weapon trained on me.

"Toss your gun!" he shouts. "Now stand up."

I stand, raising my hands.

"I should kill you where you stand, but Topa will want to interrogate you."

If he only knew I had already killed his boss, he might have thought differently about keeping me alive. My luck is looking up.

He grabs my knit mask, pulls it off my head, and my hair frizzes out, and then I tell him, "You shouldn't have done that."

He questions, "Done what?"

I stare at him coldly as I say, "You shouldn't have seen my face."

I duck and twirl, sweep kicking his legs out from underneath him, and I draw my tactical knife from the sheath on my right calf. I jump on top of the man and slit his throat before he can react, and his blood splatters my face. I hate up close Closings. They're always so messy. I look at him with no emotion or remorse. I've been trained well. I stand from the dead man and scowl. The assignment has turned into a wetworks. Blood drips from my knife, so I bend and wipe the blade on the man's pants. I hear someone running towards me, so I abruptly turn and stand ready to attack the next guard.

Earlier...

Katharine's view...

Avoiding the guards and staying clear of areas the Un-Men are in, I spot a tool shed ahead of me. I notice a lady as the lady stands from a man she killed. I halt, raise my gun, and aim at her. The lady's preventing me from moving on, and I need to get by her and fast. I see the lady's knife and wonder if she's a guard. She's not well armed. I notice the men. No, she just dropped five of them. She can't be a guard. I glance over my shoulder. It doesn't matter who she is. I need to get by her and take my revenge before the Un-Men close in on me.

Kimberly's view...

I freeze as a female guard points her weapon at me. I look at the ground where my PPK lies and then to my knife. The female guard's too far away to lunge at, but I can throw my knife. I study her face. Wait... she's not a guard, that woman's the one from Topa's office. She's the one who couldn't kill him.

Katharine's view...

I start to shoot the lady in the leg when I believe I recognize her, and a sense of joy peeks over the mound of hatred and sorrow I feel. I've never come across anyone I thought I knew, and my mission of retribution loses its priority as I ask, "Have we met before?"

Kimberly's view...

I don't answer her, considering if that woman wasn't able to shoot Topa, what chance is there that she'll shoot me?

Katharine's view...

The lady ignores my question, and I don't know where I recognize her from. I do have to determine whose side she's on, so I ask, "Do you work for the Council or maybe you're a bounty hunter working for the Factory?"

I lower my gun a little, then raise it, and make a face as my heart hammers the bio-mecha warning. I gaze past the lady and realize that I stayed too long and they've tracked me down. I feel my Ult L-E trigger, but the light show doesn't seem to bother the lady for she comes at me with her knife. Instinct takes over, and I sidestep to the right and fire as the lady leaps at me like Tarzan attacking a tigress.

Moments earlier...

Kimberly's view...

I peer at that woman as something happens to her eyes. She must be wearing some sort of electrical device on her face for sapphire flames rage about and make her whole face burn with an angry aura. I look closer but don't see a device. With that woman distracted and muttering like a crazy person, I take the opportunity and pounce, lunging with my knife. That woman reacts much faster than I thought she could. I fear this is my end as she fires, but I continue my attack even as I wonder what the demon-like blue brimstone blazing from her is. The bullet barely misses my face as I bring my knife down. She blocks the chopping blade with her gun and kicks me in the stomach, and I stumble back and notice my PPK at my feet. I can't grab it just yet, so I stare at her for a long moment as if she's Lamia, the child-eating daemon. In all my years as a Life Closer, I've never seen anything like her.

I quickly shake off my dismay and terror and focus on my gun. If I can grab the gun, I can kill that hellish woman standing before me. I start for the PPK when gunfire from an Uzi erupts from the trees behind me, and I dive to the ground. That woman fires again. I roll, pick up my gun, move to a kneeling position, and search the area for my adversary, but that woman's gone. I run and take cover behind the tool shed and look at the line of trees where the Uzi fire came from. Sparks shoot up from among the trees, and I carefully make my way there and investigate, finding two men dead. Both have a single shot through their head, and I realize that woman wasn't aiming at me. I was wrong... that woman can kill, but she didn't kill me. Black blood trickles from the men's heads, and I step closer for a better look. What are they? I kneel to them. Are they robots?

I don't have time for this, so I stand and walk to the dead guard who's still holding my knit mask. I touch my cheek as a dreadful fear creeps over me. She saw my face! Hades! That woman saw my face, and I let her escape!

* * *

Katharine's view...

Rushing into Topa's office with my gun at the ready, I find no guards within and Topa leaning back in his chair with his brains splattered across the wall. I stand there, aiming at the man. We're both frozen in the moment. Sadness and regret wash over me as the gore keeps me fixated.

Tick... Tick...

An old clock sounds, filling the otherwise silent room with the passage of time, and I lower my gun. Am I relieved someone else killed him or am I upset that the privilege was taken away from me? I don't understand my emotions. Maybe I feel a little of both, and I take a step toward him, trying to determine who killed him. I walk to his desk, examining the bullet holes. I don't think it was an Un-Man. Two shots to the head look more like the work of a Life Closer.

Tick... Tick...

The clock sounds away the seconds as I look at the black and white photos of Topa's male relatives who had accused me earlier of being a monster. Time allows my hatred and sorrow to turn into regret and self-loathing. I move to Topa and stare at his terror-filled face, and I'm ashamed of my revenge filled thoughts. It shames me to say, but I don't know if I would have killed him. I'd like to think I would have changed my mind before it was too late but...

Tick... Tick...

I catch a glimpse of a red speckled business card with a flaming bird resting on his desk and pick it up. It's a calling card left behind by a Life Closer to the N.C.P.F. so they will know it's a Closing authorized by the Assassins Guild. A barcode on the back of the card can be read by a specialized H.H.C., which the Noir Civil Police Force carries, and prove the Closing's authenticity.

Deep in thought, I hold the card as a lot clouds my mind, and so it takes me a while before I realize the image is the same. I quickly remove the business card I found at Etna Toys a year ago and compare the two. My heart leaps with excitement. They're almost identical. I review the day's events. The lady I fought... I remember how she seemed familiar. Maybe she left this card. I rush out of the office. I have to find her, and I have to ask her again if she knows me.

I make it out of the estate through the south gate about ten minutes later and run into the pale glow of a pine forest. I follow an old truck road, and it comes to a fork just as a red VX Corvette with the license plate FromAshes speeds off, kicking up dirt. I pause and glance at the two business cards. I might have found someone who knows me. I stare at the trail of smoke and dust left behind by the car. I found the lady once, I can find her again. I stare down the road till the dust settles, then place the business cards in my back pocket, and make my way to the north side of the estate. I walk up to the gnarled oak and grab my backpack and jacket and then when I sense the Un-Men are near, I hurry back into the woods.

Tall scraggly Lantern Pines fill the forest and scent the air. Scientists created Transgenic Plants that could survive without the sun, and they created the Lantern Pines by genetically modifying a yellow pine with the extra-genome of a lanternfish, producing a tree that created its own light. The bioluminescence lasts several days after the needle's death, so even the forest floor produces a ghostly glow. The Dry Clouds cease their grumblings, forever looming over the land like a menacing specter. An owl hoots as I dash by its roost, and I flee till I sense the Un-Men have ceased their pursuit. The Ultra-Epi Light Emissions dissipate, and my heart ends its warning, so I slow to a walk, and a possum scurries past. I stop in a small clearing, undo the Velcro of my armor, remove the black Ravlek Vest, and look down at my bloodied white t-shirt. I pull a clean one from my backpack, take off the soiled one, and put on the new, and then I hold the bloodied t-shirt and Bible to my chest as I sit against a tree on a bed of glowing needles. I close my eyes to sleep. Preacher, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm alone in the world again, and I miss you... I miss you so much.

Time slowly passes, but I can't sleep. Over the past year, I have learned the Ultra-Epi that courses through my blood gives me abilities, but it also causes side effects. It took me a long time to figure out that the music box counters the side effects. All I have to do is listen to the tune, go into a trance-like state, and make myself vulnerable to attack. I feel anxious; it's the first side effect of the Ultra-Epi. I stare up at the canopy of ghostly pines. Preacher, forgive me. I weep without tears. Forgive me for not saving you.

My nose runs, and I wipe it with the back of my hand. Within the serenity of the forest and in the calming effects of crickets chirping and the wind rustling pines, a realization sinks in. Preacher, what would you think of me? In my anger, I hurt people. I let people die, and I almost killed a man today. Something I promised myself I would never do under any circumstance. I hug the book tighter. Oh Preacher, can you forgive me? God, please forgive me.

I remove the music box from my pocket, open its lid, and let the melody lull me. I don't care if I'm caught. I only seek relief from my anguish, and my eyes droop as I enter what I call the Drifting Time and leave behind sorrow, regret, and hatred.
Chapter Eleven

The Siblings

Russia, the Light Side of the planet...

October 13...

Wednesday...

10:42 A.M...

Two pilots sat in the cockpit of a V.T.O. (Vertical Take Off) thirty passenger plane. Engineers designed the aircraft to fly through the polluted barriercumulus of the world's Dark Half. The pilots prepared for takeoff on one of many circular pads among hundreds of other V.T.Os. landing and taking off.

In first class, Natasha pulled up the shutter of the plane's small window, and she looked at the sun as it rose over Moscow and pulled her white fur-lined, long, black coat close to her neck. "Look Nikolai." Her Russian accent was thick as she spoke, "Is it not beautiful?"

"Yes, Tasha," her twin brother said. He wore a white pinstriped gray business suit, and a gray Fedora hat rested on his lap. "As beautiful as you."

"I heard the place we are going is grisly."

"Yes, so remember that image." He motioned to the ball of orange and told her, "Where we are going you will not see the sun again." He burned the image into his mind. "Noir exists in endless night."

She turned to him and her face was full of worry. "Nikolai, I have a bad feeling about this trip."

He stroked her long black hair and took her hand. "I know you do not like to fly. Be brave, my sister."

"It is more than that." She looked into her brother's dark brown eyes. "I feel the place we are going is full of wickedness."

He squeezed her hand gently as he said, "Do not fear, my sister, I will always be by your side."

The engines of the V.T.O. roared as the airport's tower cleared the plane for takeoff. The copilot double checked the two moveable nozzles on each wing. They produced the thrust for vertical liftoff. He pulled the V.T.O. lever down, turning the nozzles horizontal and pushed the lever up to return the nozzles to vertical. The copilot gave the all clear, the pilot ignited the thrusters, and the aircraft lifted straight up into the sky. The plane rumbled and shook with the effort as Natasha buried her head in her brother's shoulder and after a few minutes, the copilot pulled the V.T.O. lever down, and the aircraft shot across the horizon.

Nikolai leaned over, closing the shutter. "It is over, we are in the air."

"I would not be here if it was not Voice who asked us to go to Noir for this Closing." She glanced at the shutter as she added, "Be where only plastic separates us from falling to the ground."

"Take courage, my sister." He reached into his coat pocket. "I will give you some sleeping pills, then you can let this flight go by while you dream."

"You think my fear will be any less in sleep? I will only have nightmares of crashing."

He gently squeezed her hand, so she would look at him. "Tasha, have I ever let anything happen to you?"

She stared into his strong face. "No."

"Do not fear. I will protect you. Rest. I will watch over you."

"Yes, rest." She closed her eyes, remembering a wolf name Salandra from a Russian tale and quoted a line Salandra had said. "I will fight back death in my dreams."

Nikolai remembered the same story where a raven named Draven replied to the wolf, and he said, "And I will keep death away from my branch."

She took the pills from him and popped them into her mouth.

"Let us change seats," Nikolai requested. "Once you are asleep, I would like to look out of the window and witness this Curtain they speak of that divides the world."

She nodded. He grabbed his hat, stood, removed a briefcase from the overhead compartment, and switched seats with her. Natasha asked for a pillow and a blanket from a female attendant. The attendant returned with the items, and Natasha took them, put her seat back, and soon fell asleep.

Nikolai opened his briefcase and removed an old detective novel called Blood Harvest by Kit Sire. He opened the book to the first chapter titled "The Woman Wore Green And The Man Gray". Nikolai read the first chapter to himself, "It ain't no easy street for a gumshoe. Long days and even longer nights... That's me, an old bloodhound for hire. Throw me a couple of scraps, and I'm yers for the day, week, whatever it takes. If yer looking for a dame or a mucker, I'll track them down."

Nikolai leaned back and grinned. "Kit knew how to write a good story. I feel like one of the mobsters in his novels." He straightened his white tie and in a gangster accent, he said, "I'm a Hood that brings the Big Sleep. A Cat ready to blow one down. In a couple of days, I'll finally have Tommy, and I'll be my own Chopper Squad."

He continued reading as a boy with his mother sitting across the aisle from him glanced at his book.

"What's that?" the boy asked as he pointed.

Nikolai peered up from the text. "This?" He lifted the book. "It's a novel."

"A novel?" The boy wrinkled his brow. "What kind of book is that?"

"A novel tells a story. They are very rare. This one is an antique. The Corporate Senate banned the making of entertainment books long ago. Today you have to have a license to carry a novel and many other forms of books."

The boy eyed the novel curiously. "I still don't know what it is. What's a story?"

Nikolai glanced at the boy's mother who was sleeping. Surely his mother told him tales of knights and dragons in the privacy of their home.

The boy's mother woke and saw her son talking with the stranger. She noticed Nikolai reading a novel and looked at him with disgust as if he was smoking dope. She changed seats with her child, forcing the boy to sit by the window.

Nikolai returned to his reading. Hours went by, and a female attendant walked up to them, leaned over his sister, and touched his shoulder.

"Sir, we are coming up to the Curtain."

"Thank you." Nikolai raked his hand over his face and through his buzz cut.

A male passenger in the seat in front of him said to a woman, "I hear the barriercumulus spreads almost an inch every week. If the Corporate Senate doesn't find a way to stop the Dry Clouds, the whole world will be covered."

"Is that right?" the woman asked.

"As right as anything you hear," the male passenger replied.

If that was true, Nikolai's homeland would be consumed by the barriercumulus. He opened the window shutter; it was still day. He looked across the wing at about 2 o'clock and in the distance, a charcoal-gray wall of clouds spread across the horizon and consumed the sky. The dark barrier raged with movement as if two creatures fought for dominance.

Nikolai cleared his throat and said, "Excuse me."

The female attendant turned. "Yes, sir."

"Do what you call Dry Clouds, do they always look that way?" He motioned outside.

She glanced out the window and replied, "No, only the outer area known as the Curtain acts this way. Once we're inside, they will look like normal storm clouds."

"Thank you."

Nikolai watched the barriercumulus as streaks of purple lightning lit up the mass. He didn't see them as normal storm clouds. He didn't see anything normal about them.

The seat belt sign blinked on with a ding as the V.T.O. ascended, flying above the Dry Clouds of the Earth's Dark Half into the high Troposphere. The female attendant walked the aisle, making sure everyone had their belt buckled.

"Excuse me," Nikolai said.

The attendant turned to him and spoke, "Yes."

"Why are we flying above the clouds and not through them?"

"As you can see, the Curtain is very turbulent, so we fly above the Dry Clouds until we have passed the Curtain. We will be flying about five miles in." She glanced over her shoulder when she heard another attendant call button, and then the attendant turned back to Nikolai. "It's safer to fly above them and then descend once we reach our destination." She started down the aisle to the other passenger. "We'll be over the outer edge of Noir shortly."

He turned to his sister and told her while she slept, "Not much longer and it will be over."

Within twenty minutes, the pilot slowed the plane as the copilot pushed the V.T.O. Lever up, turning the aircraft's nozzles to their vertical position, and the plane hovered. The pilot closed the air intake valves to the engines with a flick of his finger and switched to a stored clean air source. If the plane used outside air while moving through the barriercumulus, the pollutants would cause the engines to clog and die.

"Perhaps my sister is right," Nikolai said as the aircraft started a vertical descent to one of Noir's Airports. "This place is a wicked place."

The plane hit heavy turbulence, entering the Dry Clouds. He feared his sister would wake and panic, but she continued to sleep soundly. A few minutes passed, and the shaking subsided.

"If I could have everyone's attention," a male attendant announced over the intercom. "We will be landing shortly, and at this time please pull out the kits that were issued to you when you boarded. Our staff will be walking around to assist you." The male attendant paused as he helped an elderly lady remove a kit from underneath her seat.

Nikolai closed the shutter and gently shook his sister. "Tasha, wake. We are landing in the Rising Sun Sector of Noir, and soon we will be on a hovertrain to the Hellenistic Sector."

"Hmm..." She stretched and yawned. "Already? I did dream as you said. I dreamed of a sky full of stars."

He said, "I did tell you."

The male attendant announced over an intercom, "Inside your kits, you'll find an instruction booklet." He raised the handbook. "A Winnow Mask type A." The attendant lifted a small triangular device with a rubber rim which fitted over the nose and connected to a filter. "And the Liquid Oxygen Spray is known as L-O." He raised what looked like a fat ball-point pen. "Please wear the WM-A anytime you go outside, and it will keep you from feeling the ill effects of the pollutants caused by the petroleum based clouds. They can be dangerous for those not used to living below Dry Clouds." He paused. "The triangular filter fits over your nose. Breathe in through this filter and out through your mouth. The basic design mask has to be held to the face. If you find that you are outside a lot, you can purchase an upgraded version of the Winnow Mask that is handsfree." The attendant demonstrated and removed the mask. "If you should feel queasy or light headed, inject yourself with the L-O Spray and this will give your bloodstream a burst of oxygen."

The attendant paused for a moment. "Place the spray's head on your bare wrist or neck, press the red button on the top, and the solution absorbs right through your skin. Your body will take some time to get used to the air, so please keep your kits with you at all times. These items can be replaced at any drug store. If you have any questions, an attendant will help you."

Natasha looked at the mask. "They are not very fashionable, are they?" She whined, "I wish to be done with this Closing."

Nikolai turned to her. "Patience, sister. We will return to Mother Russia in time."
Chapter Twelve

Nexus Apartments

4:35 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Kimberly's view...

I drive my Corvette into the parking garage of the Nexus Apartments. I had stopped earlier at a gas station and changed out of my black clothes into a blue pantsuit and made sure to wash the splattered blood from my face. I get out of the car, make my way to my apartment, go in, and throw my knapsack on the couch in the living room. I go to the hall, walk to my bedroom, go into my bathroom, lean on the sink, and stare at myself in the mirror.

"Idiot!" I shout at myself. I let myself be seen. I turn on the faucet and watch the water run down the drain as the security I had in my job washes down the tube. I should have gone after that woman and killed her but no... I look up and stare at myself again. I panicked and ran. "Hades!"

I glance into my bedroom as the water continues to run. The screensaver of the flaming phoenix flies across the laptop, and the glow lights up the dark room, casting shadows across the floor and walls. I turn and face the sink and splash some water on my face, trying to wash away my anxiety over what the Assassins Guild will do to me once they find out my identity has been compromised. I dry my face with a towel then go and sit at my desk. I press the space bar to wake up my laptop, hoping also to wake up from this nightmare of my own making, and then I send an instant message and within minutes, a reply comes back.

"Topa's Closing is complete then," Voice types. "The payment will be placed into your account. Did you run into any trouble?"

I start to type no, but then I backspace and respond, "About a dozen robot-like men showed up and killed everyone in sight."

"Must be some sort of bio-mecha, perhaps the next generation of assassins," Voice types. "Most likely someone there was their target, but was it Topa? We'll probably never know, at least you got out."

I rake my hand through my hair, knowing the grave mistake I've made, and I move my hands toward the keyboard to write, and they shake with dread as I force myself to type, "Someone saw my face." I hit the send button and stare at the screen, and two grueling minutes pass with no reply. "What should I do?" I hit the send button again, hoping for a reply and praying for some guidance and solace.

"Find them and kill them. You know it is very dangerous, Phoenix. Even I don't know who you are or what you look like. If your identity gets out, you will become the target, and then the Assassins Guild will be forced to deal with you." The statement ends and another follows. "But before that happens, you know I will step in, and you don't want me to rectify the problem. You know my means."

I do know and there's no reprimand for a Closer. I grab the sides of my desk and grip them tightly. With Voice and the Assassins Guild, there's only one way to deal with a Closer who has lost their anonymity, and it's the sanctioning of their own Life Closing.

"Don't contact me again until this matter is taken care of. Voice signing off."

I glance at the dark afternoon through the bedroom's window as I roll my chair away from the desk. I have to find that woman, but I don't know her name. I only know she was there to kill Topa because he hired an Illicit Closer to murder someone named Preacher. I don't even know what he was a preacher of.

Hades... This is going to be impossible.

* * *

Two days later...

October 15...

Friday...

6:49 A.M...

Katharine's view...

Hundreds of street lights light up twilight as a horde of bats darts across the ever dark horizon. The sidewalk goes on forever in both directions as I make my way across West 1000 Avenue and pause, looking at the tall Nexus Apartments. It's the building of the Phoenix's nest. I walked all night and morning to reach this part of the Hellenistic Sector, and my shoes are like ten-pound dumbbells on my poor sore feet. I adjust the strap of the backpack that crosses my chest as I study the sensors on a ten-foot concrete wall lining the building's perimeter. They consist of a black sphere the size of a volleyball and are spaced about ten feet apart along the top of the wall. I follow the sidewalk to a gate, and on the gate's metal bars is a gold shield which is the Sphinx Corporation Emblem. I run my hand over the shield and then over a winged creature in its center with a woman's head and a lion's body. The creature's right paw is lifted, and its claws are extended. The emblem seems to plague every place I go. Even the Council and the Factory are departments within the Sphinx Corporation. I study the perimeter and wondered if the sensors provide more than security for the building. I put my hand up toward a black sphere, and I feel and hear a hum coming from the device. I visualize a bio-mecha approaching one of these things and being deterred so these spheres must act as a barrier.

A white van pulls up, and a man gets out and walks up beside me. He's dressed in a white uniform and I get no dangerous vibe off of him as he says, "Excuse me."

I move out of his way, and the man tips his white cap. "Thanks." He presses the button to an intercom positioned beside the gate and releases it.

"Welcome to Nexus Apartments," a man's voice says over the intercom. "I'm the manager. How may I help you?"

The delivery man presses the button again and speaks, "Delivery for Kimberly Griffin. Security Code 10 Alpha."

After a few seconds, the manager replies, "Code verified. Proceed to the gate that faces Knot Street, and I'll let you in."

The delivery man goes back to his van, starts up the engine, turns down Knot Street, and parks as I follow the sidewalk around the corner, walk by the vehicle's passenger seat, and notice it's empty. The delivery man gets out, strolls to the back of the van as he whistles, and then starts on a crate.

I watch as the man struggles to load a rectangular box on a flat cart, and then I ask him, "Where's your partner?"

"What did you say?" he questions as he pauses, wiping his brow with the back of his hand.

I lean on the back of the van. "Usually at least two men do this kind of job, so where's your partner?"

The delivery man points his thumb over his shoulder. "He's out sick."

"Would you like some help?" I motion to the apartments. "I was on my way up."

He looks me over. "I'm not supposed to cause of business policy but... You aren't some murdering psycho are you?"

"No. Definitely not."

"Well then..." He places the wooden crate on the cart. "If you could push from behind, this thing weighs a ton."

I head to the back of the cart and push on the crate. The apartment manager and a security guard meet us at the gate.

The old white haired manager looks over his H.H.C. "Kimberly Griffin isn't home right now, so I'll show you in." He examines the delivery man's employee badge and types the ID number on the Hand Held Computer. "Follow me please."

The delivery man pulls the cart as I push, and we move to the glass front doors where another security guard buzzes us in. The manager leads us to a service elevator, and we along with the guard head up to the thirty-first floor. Security cameras monitor the hallways.

The manager stops in front of Kimberly's apartment and commands, "Apartment H, unlock. Manager code 12 Beta."

"Voice recognized as Nexus' Manager," the Apartment Computer System states. "Opening door."

"Wow," the delivery man exclaims. "Automated apartments. I bet you can tell the lights to come on."

The manager says, "Our apartments are equipped with voice commands and manual utilities, giving our tenants the best in security and luxury."

"I'll have to look into getting one of these places," the delivery man states.

He pulls the cart down a small entryway as I push and once we're in the living room, the delivery man starts uncrating a cedar chest, so I go and look around. The lady's apartment's huge and covers more than three thousand square feet. The entryway empties into an open kitchen with four barstools at the counter, a large living room is off to the left, beyond it down a hall are two bedrooms and two baths, and off to the right of the entryway, a small round table sits next to a window.

I do think it's odd that the table's so small, considering it's the only one in the apartment. I ask the delivery man, "Do you need any more help?"

"No, I got it from here. Thanks."

I leave, note the apartment's letter H on the door, head for the regular elevator, go up to the roof, and wait. I watch what little traffic travels West 1000 Avenue as I grip the icy metal railing that surrounds the top of the roof. Finally, I'll have some answers once I meet the lady who owns the two business cards.

A cool breeze sweeps in, chilling the air and my thoughts, so I zip up my athletic jacket, but it does little to stay off the cold. I have no idea what I'll learn from the lady, so I clench the jacket over my heart with my right fist as if in pain. I dread discovering the truth about myself, wondering if it will be worse than the unbearable ignorance I've endured the past year. Whatever happens next, it'll change my life forever.

End Katharine's view...

Back in Apartment H...

The delivery man finished his work and set the cedar chest against the wall in the living room out of the way. He placed the crate pieces back on his cart, had the manager sign for the package, and headed back to his van and once inside the vehicle, he made a cell phone call.

"I would like to speak with R.G." He waited for a moment. "Hello, Delivery Man here. Yes, my work is finished, and as per your instructions, I permitted Katharine to enter with me into the Nexus Apartments. She's still there." He paused for a moment, listening. "Yes, so far security doesn't know she is still on the premises. Do you want me to monitor the situation?" He started up the engine and drove the van, heading away. "Understood. Returning to base."
Chapter Thirteen

Confrontation

7:22 A.M...

On the roof...

Katharine's view...

I lean on the metal railing and continue staring at the road below and at times of quiet stillness, I feel the barriercumulus, and their presence is like an evil eidolon. If this is true, who does this phantom look-alike belong to?

The Dry Clouds softly roll and unsettle me, and they have done so ever since I first laid eyes on them, but there's also something else about the Dry Clouds; it's a hint of familiarity. I can't explain it, but today the foreboding's stronger than the familiarity. Is it because they're unnatural? Does everyone feel this way around them or is it just me? I watch them go by and look for shapes within the clouds and see an old sailing ship being chased by a sea serpent. The Dry Clouds have been around for thirty-two years and have been given the name the Great Specter of Noir. People also say that they're a mystery. I chuckle. In a way, we're the same.

An hour goes by, and I notice the Corvette pull into the parking garage. I jump up and down like a little girl who has just got the pony she wished for. I want to run back down and meet her and ask her all my questions, but I contain my excitement and wait a few more minutes, giving the lady enough time to arrive at her apartment. I don't want to come at her like some crazy person, so I'll have to keep my cool.

A few minutes later...

Kimberly's view...

I hear a ding and the whoosh of the elevator opening and then someone approaches me as I put my mail in my dark green purse that matches my pantsuit. I stand outside of my apartment and realize how odd it is that I've never seen any of the other tenants the whole time I've lived here. I need to at least get a glimpse of one of my neighbors, so I turn. My Closer training kicks in a second before I have a chance to panic as I spot that woman I've been hunting. For two days, I scoured Noir and turned the city on its head, but I couldn't find anything on this mysterious woman, not even her name. I drop some of my mail as I open my purse to grab my PPK, but then I remember the floor's security cameras. I can't kill her out here, not unless she threatens me, so I wait for that woman's next move.

Katharine's view...

Elated and full of expectations, I stop about two yards from the lady. Finally, after a year of knowing nothing, I'll have some answers. I can't stand my excitement anymore, so I question her as if I already know the answer, and I'm ready to give my old friend a big hug, "Are you Kimberly Griffin?"

The lady looks confused and very on edge like I'll pull my gun on her at any moment, but it's tucked away in my backpack. She must see me as threatening, so I smile real big to show her I'm a safe person as I repeat, "Is your name Kimberly Griffin?"

Kimberly's view...

"Yes," I reply as I step back and size up that woman who's smirking at me like some lunatic ready to murder me. I put out a lot of feelers while I was looking for her, maybe she already knows I've been hunting her and has come to strike before I can. I realize something else. She knows my name, so I have to eliminate her now. I reexamine her cheerful face, and she looks happy to see me like we're best friends and we haven't seen each other in years. I can't figure out why she's putting on this act and not attacking me unless she's also waiting to strike when there are no witnesses.

She says to me, "I had a contact in the Noir Civil Police Force look up your address from your license plate. It cost me two months worth of water rations." She starts to ask me something and looks over her shoulder at the cameras. She removes two business cards, shows me the blood speckled one, and then questions me, "Is this you?"

I grip the gun in my purse so sure that woman reaches for a weapon, but I'm surprised to see the business cards. I can't figure out what kind of game she's playing, and a million things go through my mind. That woman tracked me down and came all the way to my apartment. Is she hoping to blackmail me? Only an idiot would think they could blackmail a Life Closer.

I scan the hall to see if anyone else is on the floor and ask, "What do you mean, is that me?"

Katharine's view...

"I've been looking for..." I start to answer and then decide I shouldn't say the Phoenix out loud. Someone could be listening, and the lady might not want anyone else to know, so I continue, "I've been looking for this... Umm..." I flip the card over, look at the picture, and turn it back to her. "This firebird. Is this you? If so, I'd like to talk."

Kimberly's view...

I can't let her leave, and I can't kill her out here. I glance at the hall's cameras. If I can only get that woman into my apartment, then I can... I wickedly grin as I visualize myself shooting that woman and then I see myself standing over her lifeless body. All I'll have to do is call Voice for a Guild Prep/Cleanup Crew, and I'll have this annoyance taken care of.

That woman reaches down, picks up my dropped mail, and hands it to me as she asks, "This isn't a bad time, is it?"

"No, of course not," I answer.

It's almost too easy but still, I have to be on my guard; it could be a trick.

"Come on in," I say as I take the mail from her still wary of that woman and command, "Door, unlock." The door slides sideways. I motion for the woman to go in first, and then I follow. "Door, lock," I command, and the door closes, entombing us.

The Apartment Computer System turns on the lights as we enter each room as it tells me, "Welcome back Ms. Griffin and welcome guest. The apartment–"

"Mute," I command.

That woman walks down the entry, stops, and studies the kitchen. She walks over to the faucet, glances back at me, and says, "I see no scanner for a Water Ration Card. Your water isn't portioned?"

I look at the sink then think of the shower and bathtub and realize I never thought about it. Most of the city's given an allotment for the month and here I enjoy unlimited. I'm wary of that woman's suspicious questions. Is she trying to distract me or is she really this naive?

I answer, "No, my water isn't portioned."

"Oh, you must be rich then."

She sets her backpack on the black leather couch, walks over to the small round table, and sits as if she's here for a visit. I start to pull out my gun, notice the cedar chest in the living room, and turn my attention back to that woman.

She sees the teacup I left earlier that morning and states, "Tea. I love tea." She turns wide-eyed like a kid asking for a piece of candy. "Could I have some, please? I haven't had tea in a long time."

"Tea?"

I glance at the kettle on the stove then at my purse. She has to be joking. She has to be here to kill me. I'm not sure what to do, but then I think of Topa's Closing. Maybe I can find out what was going on there, so I'll play along for now, and I answer her, "Sure, why not. Let's have some tea. Is black okay?"

I don't wait for an answer as I carefully position my purse on the counter, so I'll have quick access to my gun.

"Yes, black tea is fine."

Keeping a close tab on that woman, I fill the kettle, place the stainless steel pot on the burner, and turn it on high. "So..." I place two sets of cups and saucers on the counter. "Who are you and why have you come to see me?"

Katharine's view...

Heavyhearted over Preacher's death and still weary from the endless running, I laugh a melancholy chuckle as I stare at the table. "That's a good question."

I reach into my pant's pocket for my dearest possessions. They've been with me since the beginning, and maybe now one of them will lead me to the answers I desperately seek and a place I yearn to belong.

Kimberly's view...

When that woman reaches into her pocket, I go for my purse and start to grab my gun until I see the items that woman removes. She places a small silver box, two business cards, and a worn paper on the table, and then she opens the paper. She answers as she seems to be studying the writing, "Katharine, I think. If this note is meant for me."

I could shoot her now that that woman's distracted and end this game. The kettle shrieks, stealing away the moment, so I turn the burner off, remove the pot, and pour hot water into the cups. The aroma of orange fills the air as I say, "Note? I don't understand."

"Huh?" She turns to me. "Oh, I guess you wouldn't. You see, I don't know who I am." She looks back to the items. "The only clues to my identity are these three things." She seems unsure herself as she adds, "At least, I think they are."

What an unlikely story? I carry the two saucers to the table with my purse strapped over my shoulder as I try to figure out her ploy. I set a teacup in front of her and one at my spot. Either that woman is very clever or very stupid.

"See..." she says as she gives the paper to me.

I read the note, "Katharine, you must not fail. This is your last chance to redeem yourself. I know you can complete your mission, my dearest Kat. I am counting on you. Signed, R.G." I peer up from the note. "Who is R.G.?"

She shrugs.

"I don't understand. What does this have to do with me?" I ask as I hand back the note.

She folds the paper, picks up the business cards, and then explains to me, "For the past year, I've been trying to figure out how these clues fit in my life, and now I've found a person who belongs to one of these items." She slides the red speckled card across the table. "I found this at Topa's." She places the second one beside the other. "This one I've had."

I look over the blood covered business card I left beside Topa, pick up the second business card, and ask, "Where did you get this one?" I examine it more closely. "This is an earlier design from years ago."

Katharine's view...

"I'll start from the beginning."

I dip the tea bag in my hot water several times, drain the bag with a spoon, and place it on the saucer. I breathe in its citrus scent and stare at the brownish liquid. Sitting here seems so familiar to me like I've been here before.

"About a year ago, I awoke in the abandoned Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse with no memory. Beside me on a table was this note–" I begin as I tap the paper and point to the other two items, "–that business card, and this music box." I look at the backpack on the couch where I stowed the Beretta. With an aversion to having to carry the gun, I add, "And one other item."

"What you're saying is, you don't know who you are, and you think because you have one of my business cards, you're supposed to find me? Okay... You have. Now what?"

I pick up the honey bear, draw a smiley face on the spoon, and whisper, "Fly... fly away, sad, sad day."

Kimberly's view...

What's that woman doing playing with the honey? She has to be out of her mind coming into my home like we're friends.

"Now what?" that woman repeats my question as she shrugs. "I don't know. I was hoping you knew me." She seems to be examining my face again as she inquires, "Are you sure we haven't met? You look very familiar, but I can't place you. It's kind of like when you wake from a dream. You know something happened but all the details are fuzzy."

"No, we haven't met," I answer, irritated, and then I remember our first meeting at Topa's estate and decide I might as well get some information from her before I eliminate that woman, so I state, "I am curious. What were those things you killed at the estate? Were they some kind of robot and why were they there?"

Her gaze becomes distant, exhausted, and dismal as she replies, "They're bio-mechas, model Un-Men." She flushes as if she's a little embarrassed. "They were there to hunt me."

"Hunt you?" I chuckle, thinking she made it up. "Why are you so important?"

"I don't know. They call me the Pandora Project."

First her names Katharine and now her name's Pandora. I wish she'd make up her mind or come up with a better story. I decide to continue playing along like I somewhat believe her and ask, "They? Who are they?"

"The Council. A man named Argus said they were monitoring me and watching me through the tests." She mutters as her eyes show fatigue, "And there have been so many tests."

"Pandora..." I repeat, and then I remember a story I heard long ago. "I've heard of her. She was a woman who opened a sealed box from Zeus and let all good escape from existence, so are you supposed to be the woman who doomed the world?"

Katharine's view...

"Let all good escape?" I utter. I never considered the significance of the project name.

Kimberly answers nonchalantly, "Yes, Pandora caused Mankind to suffer."

I stare out the window at the dark day for a few moments, wondering if my destiny is to make people suffer. I don't want anyone to get hurt, so many people have already been hurt because they knew me. I feel conflicted inside about my purpose.

"I guess this was another dead end," I tell Kimberly as I push back my chair. "I guess my search continues. I'm sorry I bothered you. I'll show myself out."

"Are you so naive?" Kimberly stands and reaches into her purse. "Idiot! Do you know what I do for a living?"

"You're Kimberly Griffin." I glance at the business cards on the table. "You're the Phoenix." I pause as the horrible realization sinks in. "You're a Life Closer." I stare at the splattered blood on one of the cards. "You kill people." Appalled by my own naivety and Kimberly's apparent ruthlessness, I turn my gaze to her. "You kill people for money."

"Idiot! And to think I was worried I let you slip by at Topa's estate." Kimberly removes her gun and screws on its silencer. "You do understand I can't let you live." She shakes her head in a tisk-tisk manner. "You've seen my face, know my alias, and even been in my apartment." Her expression shows outrage and disbelief. "I don't think I've ever met someone so stupid!" Kimberly takes a moment to regain her cold detached demeanor. "You were searching for me, hoping to find answers but–" With indifference and a just business attitude, she raises the gun and aims it at me as she says, "–all you've found is your death."
Chapter Fourteen

A Forgotten Melody

8:32 A.M...

Katharine's view...

I look down the barrel of Kimberly's gun, wondering how I could be so wrong. It's not the first time I've stared at death, but it's unexpected and in confusion, I turn to the table and gaze at the three items that led me to this point. I have been foolish, and I fist my hands. I believed the items were clues and if I followed them, I would find answers, not my end. I close my eyes in frustration. I've been so stupid feeling I'm safe here.

Kimberly's view...

I prepare to kill that strange woman. Her death will be like countless other Life Closings I've performed in the past except this one will involve more paperwork, and it'll be the first one I have executed inside my apartment. I notice she doesn't panic and doesn't plead for her life like most Marks do. That woman only stares at my gun and then she closes her eyes as if she deserves her death. A little surprised by her actions, I ask, "Are you sure you didn't hit your head? Do you understand you're going to die?"

Katharine's view...

I open my eyes and rub my forehead, remembering the wound I had when I first awoke in Etna Toys. The urgency of the situation finally sinks in, and my attitude changes as I repeat Kimberly's words, "You can't let me live?"

I feel my demeanor transform from a wide-eyed child to the fierce glare of a cornered tigress. I look at the backpack that holds my gun, but it's across the room. I consider this could be one of the tests and that Kimberly might just be another assassin hired by the Council. I go over in my mind how to incapacitate her. I still can't believe I let my guard down. My face softens as I think about how I felt so at home here. I stare at the tea, not wanting to hurt Kimberly. It's like I'm cursed to always end up in these situations.

"Idiot," Kimberly utters in a calm voice as she places the muzzle of the gun against my temple. "It's going to be messy. Your brains will splatter all over my table and wall. Why couldn't you have died at Topa's estate?"

Ignoring her, I glance at the clues to my life. What's the point in fighting or in fleeing? I pick up the music box. What does it matter if Kimberly kills me or I fall prey to one of the Un-Men or some other assassin? I heave a great sigh as if it'll be my last breath on Earth. I'm tired, so I open the lid to the music box, and the melody plays. I'm tired of the tests, and I'm tired of being alone. I feel myself slipping into the Drifting Time as the tune continues, then my eyes slowly close, I go into a trance and enter the Drifting Time, but this one's different than the ones before. Within it, I enter the domain of dreams and in this realm of my subconscious, no Dry Clouds exist, the sun shines on the land, governments, not corporations rule the Earth, and no one hunts me. I drift in this world on my stomach as if floating on a peaceful river. A breeze blows at my back, and the air smells crisp and clean. I pass over large cities and small villages. I fly over many races of Man. I float over forests, hills, deserts, oceans, islands, plains, lakes, jungles, mountains, and streams. I believe I recognize a few of the places, but I can't remember their names. The dream seems endless until the wind changes. A torrent of air blows against me and slows my progression as a shadow casts over the land, invading the peacefulness. A male voice laughs, and the sun flees as Dry Clouds storm in and plunge the land into perpetual night. I feel afraid as I glide over this dark world, seeing no more of the places and people I saw. Everything's different and darker in their appearance and atmosphere. I stop midair as if I slam into an invisible wall, then an unknown force pulls me, and I plummet to the earth. The force also affects time and as I drop, I grow younger till I reach my early teens. My descent slows, and my thirteen-year-old body lands feet first in a white-tiled room and in the room, people talk with muffled words. Two women's figures appear, but they have no faces.

One of the faceless women places her hands on my shoulders and tells me, "Katharine, you must be strong. I can no longer protect you." The woman looks to a door, hearing footsteps approach what appears to be an office, and then the faceless woman turns back to me. "There are those in the corporation who want to exploit you."

The doorknob jiggles as someone tries to enter, and I hear one of the women speak again, but I'm not sure which one it is.

"Rosetta, they're here. Hurry."

"Quick, Mary. Push the desk against the door. I need more time!"

One of the women kneels to one knee to look into my face and tells me, "They will take you. I can't stop them, not with the power I have now."

Someone outside tries to bust in the door.

One of the women yells, "Hurry! They're coming."

"Be strong, Katharine." One of the women strokes my cheek. "My dearest Kat."

A small explosion removes the door from its hinges, and it falls as five soldiers rush in.
Chapter Fifteen

Portraits Of Her Past

Dawn, dusk, and twilight did not exist in Noir since the sun no longer ruled over the land. Shadows gathered in the park across the street from Nexus Apartments and held position, and the gathering stared at the building, knowing their target lay within. The shadows detected an electronic barrier surrounding the building and like a magical curtain, it prevented the glowing-eyed monsters from entering, so for the moment, they would wait till the prey came to them.

Within Apartment H...

Kimberly's view...

All I have to do to rid myself of this strange woman is pull the trigger, and then she'll be gone from my life like any other Mark I have come across on my morbid travels. I only need to continue walking the path my bleak and lonely existence has already led me down, but a split second of time changes the course of both our fates. Unfinished Melody chimes from the music box that woman holds, filling the room with a familiar tune. Louder and louder the music grows until the melody incites a trigger and ghastly images inundate my mind. I hear the roar and smell of fire, screams that chill my soul, and the distinct sound of three shots. My head throbs, and I gasp as horrible pictures buried deep in my brain force their way to the surface. Memories of my mom rapidly flood my consciousness, making me feel sad, alone, and abandoned.

"Stop it!" I yell, but the tune chimes on, pulling from my psyche portraits of my past I long buried.

I separated myself from those happy moments that died when my mom left my family, but they come screaming back. I need to rid my mind of them, but that woman doesn't respond to my demand, caught within the recesses of her own mind, so I slap her hand. I knock the music box to the floor and as I slap her hand, I inadvertently move my gun away from her head.

"I said stop it!!"

The music box closes as it hits the carpet, and the melody ends. I stare at it for a few moments, turn my attention back to that woman, and snap, "I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but it won't work on me. Do you hear me? Are you going to stay silent? Aren't you going to plead for your life? No? Well, it wouldn't have done you any good."

I start to move the gun back to her head.

Katharine's view...

Within my dream, five soldiers barge into the white-tiled room, and Rosetta and Mary scream as three shots resound, and then all fades to black.

"No!" I scream as I pull from my trance, swing my hand up and back, and shout, "Mary! Rosetta!"

I knock Kimberly's gun to the side, and it goes off, and a bullet strikes the wall. The gun blast lights up Kimberly's surprised face. Still caught within the drama of my dream, I make a fist, pull it back to hit her, and pause, realizing I'm no longer standing in the white-tiled room but in the apartment. There's no fire or soldiers, and no one's in danger but myself. I slowly blink, frozen in place, and then I lower my hand.

I caught Kimberly off guard, but she quickly recovers, and she aims the gun back at me. I ignore her at first as I cling to what I remember while in the Drifting Time. I can't hold on to the memories for very long, and they slowly leave me. I turn to Kimberly and realize I hit her, and I'm worried I might have hurt her.

"I'm sorry," I tell her as the last remnants of the dream world fade away. "I didn't mean to–"

Kimberly's view...

"Who are you?" I interrupt as my emotions overwhelm me. I haven't felt such fear or heartache in a very long time, and I don't understand why I'm feeling them now. It doesn't make sense, so I demand, "Why are you here?"

My head continues to throb as I step back from the table, getting some distance between myself and that strange woman.

Katharine's view...

I notice her trembling hand and that her eyes are watering, and I feel a little pang in my chest and ask, "Are you crying?"

"No," Kimberly replies as she wipes her eyes. "Shut up and sit there!" She rubs her throbbing temple and asks, "Who sent you?"

I cross my arms and pout, "You just told me to shut up, so how can I..?"

"Ahhh!" Kimberly yells as she grabs my t-shirt, balls it in her hand, and demands, "Who sent you?"

I drop my arms to my side as I repeat, "Sent me?"

She loses her professionalism and like a common thug, Kimberly thrust her gun in my face and yells, "Yes, who sent you to mess with my head?" She releases my t-shirt and puts that hand on the gun to steady her shaky aim.

"No one," I tell her, and then I add, "I'm with no one." I'm very concerned that I might have hurt her, so I start to stand as I ask, "Are you all right?"

Kimberly's view...

"Don't move! Sit right there!" I scream at that woman as I take another step back, getting squeamish. Since the flood of memories, I've felt as if we're not alone and that some person has been watching us. My headache fades as I glance at a shelf in between the entry and the living room where my mom's picture rests. My mom's photo gazes at me and watches me threaten that woman, and my mom's eyes are more alive than ever.

I whisper to the picture, "I can't take a life with you staring at me." I lower my gun as I question her as if she's here, "Why did you forsake me? Why did you abandon me?"

Katharine's view...

I look at where Kimberly's looking, and I see a photo and at first, I think the picture's of Kimberly, but then I realize the lady with blonde hair pulled back in a bun's not her. The blonde lady seems familiar, but I can't place her.

"Is that your mo..." I start to ask, but then I put a hand on my chest.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I quickly turn and stare out the window down at the street. I feel the urgency to flee as Ultra-Epi courses through my blood, and I utter, "They're here."

"Who's here?" Kimberly questions me still notably upset.

"The Un-Men," I reply as I point. "They're just outside."

I begin to wonder why they haven't come in, and then I remember the apartment's black spheres and realize the barrier must be keeping them out.

Kimberly glances out the window and says, "I don't see anyone."

"I can feel them. They're out there. Six of them."

"You're imagining things," she tells me as she walks over to the couch, picks up my backpack, and tosses it to me. "Get out of here."

I catch it and glance down at the bag as I say, "I don't understand. I thought you couldn't let me live."

"What part of, get out of here, don't you understand? I'm not going to kill you, at least not here," Kimberly yells at me, then she glances at the picture, and mutters, "Not in front of her." She points to the entry and shouts, "Now get out!"

I know what will happen to me once I leave the safety of the apartment, so I plead, "Please don't make me leave. I don't want to live like that anymore."

Kimberly's view...

"Like what?" I ask, not really caring. All I know is that woman has to be mental. Anyone else would run at the chance to escape the Phoenix's fury.

I yell, "Get out! Get out before I change my mind, and I kill you now!"

Katharine's view...

Filled with hopelessness, I stand, grab the note and worn business card, and leave the blood speckled one on the table. I bend down, snatch up the music box, and put the three items in my pocket. I sling the backpack across my chest and head out and within a minute, I stand in front of the elevator and see Kimberly watching me from the apartment. The cab opens, I walk in and a few minutes later, the doors open to the ground floor. I walk out as if going to my own execution, continue through the building's front doors, then into the courtyard, and I stop halfway to the gate. Once I walk through it, the Un-Men can attack me and the hunts will begin again. I hope Kimberly will change her mind, and I glance over my shoulder and see her watching me from the entrance making sure I leave. Disheartened, I pull the business card from my thigh pocket. It's one of the three clues to my identity or is it? Are any of them? Maybe these aren't meant for me or... maybe they're just another test, a test to see what I'll do with them. I fist my hand. I'm an idiot to believe any different. I don't need it anymore and drop it to the path, watching it fall to the concrete as one hope dies. First Preacher and now this... I don't think I can take that much more.

I sniff my runny nose and force my mind to move on to the current crisis. I remove my gun from the backpack and check the magazine; it has four bullets. It won't be easy with six Un-Men out there. I remove the Ravlek Vest from the outside of the backpack, put it on over my jacket, open the gate, and step out to the sidewalk.

West 1000 Avenue is as desolate as my life. I cross the street. Lamp posts line the path heading into the empty Zeus Park as Tainted Rain pours from the thundering sky, and I shiver in the cold rain as my hair soaks with the black filmy water. I slow my pace to hold off the inevitable attack and give me time to prepare and observe my surroundings. The Ultra-Epi causes anxiety with my inactivity.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

Filled with gloom, I ignore the bio-mecha warning and pause, watching the Transgenic Grass soak up the rain. I don't want to think about the danger that lies before me. I want to be free of strife. At least for a few minutes, I can let my mind think of other things other than my own possible death, so I focus on the grass.

Scientists modified the Kentucky Bluegrass with an extra-genome from the bath sponge, and they then modified it further. What they created is a hybrid plant capable of absorbing large amounts of Tainted Rain. I feel the Un-Men move into position, and I know only moments remain before they attack. The Transgenic Grass releases the H2O properties of the liquid to be absorbed back into the atmosphere through the water cycle. All absorbing Transgenic Plants are created with the water release function in the World's attempt to correct the Dry Clouds problem. The Un-Men separate and circle me. Why do I know this information? Why do I know the grass then uses the petroleum base of the liquid to create energy? How do I know that it's how the plant survives? If scientists can do this... What could they have done to me? I look at my gun hand, thinking of my uncanny marksmanship and consider what they have done to me.

I feel the Un-Men watching, and I hurry past a metal bench. A green line of light hits my hand as a spot, and I watch it as the laser aim moves up my arm to my chest. Five more green laser aims pinpoint kill shots on my body. I remove my backpack, throw it back to the bench, and unset the safety on my Beretta. I dash for cover in a thicket of trees, splashing through puddles of Tainted Rain as gunfire erupts around me and several shots strike my back. The spongy Transgenic Grass cushions my fall as I roll with the impacts and after I roll, I arch my back for the pain, force myself to move on, and spring to my feet. I have to run! I have to run or I'll die!
Chapter Sixteen

They Are Here

9:59 A.M...

Nexus Apartments' courtyard...

Moments earlier...

Kimberly's view...

Hades! This is ridiculous! I watch that woman leave and see the look of hurt she gives me before walking through the gate. Why didn't I kill her? And why did that woman look at me as if we're friends and we just had a bad fight?

I follow her, pause, and glance through the gate's metal bars as that woman crosses the street. I let her escape again, and then I notice something at my feet. Oh, my Zeus! I see the Phoenix business card on the path. That little... Why did she drop this out here? I definitely don't need someone finding my calling card, so I pick it up and place it in my purse, then I watch that woman enter the park. I decide to follow her and push the gate open, looking for the Un-Men that woman mentioned. After crossing West 1000 Avenue, I trail that woman and head into the park as a few black droplets fall on the sleeve of my dark green pantsuit, and then thousands fall from the menacing sky.

"Great, just great!"

Rain... and me without an umbrella. I hide behind a large Transgenic Maple a couple hundred feet away from her.

End Kimberly's view...

The tree like the Lantern Pine created its own light with the help of an extra-genome from a firefly. The light emanated from the maple's trunk and branches. Its leaves grew upside down to gather the light for photosynthesis.

Kimberly's view...

Strands of my hair fall in my face as Tainted Rain darkens them, and I rake them behind my ear. I don't know why I followed her. I still need to kill her, but that's not it. Do I believe that woman can detect the Un-Men beyond the visual plain? My suit jacket soaks through. Hades! I'll catch a cold if I stay out here much longer.

In the distance, I see that woman pause and the beams of green light hit her. Someone's aiming at her, so I search the park. Gunfire erupts from all around the park, lighting up the bushes and trees with muzzle flashes as I duck into a thicket of trees. I pull my gun from my purse, hearing movement coming from my left and my right. I turn and lean my back against a maple as the area falls silent.

Are the Un-Men really hunting that woman? Is there a bounty on her head or a more malevolent reason? I remember our conversation from before. That woman said the Council called her the Pandora Project. She also said that they're testing her. I hear more gunfire. What kind of mess did I get myself into by following that woman here?

Katharine's view...

I frantically crawl through the small trees deeper into the park and then catch sight of a small tunnel underneath a stone bridge about twenty yards away. I desperately run for it and enter the tunnel, and then an Un-Man steps out at the other end and activates my abilities. Over the past year, I've learned many things about myself, about the Pandora Project, and I know my abilities come in levels. The level I just entered is the Beta Phase, and I can't miss any target when I'm in this phase. I quickly aim with my extraordinary gift, fire once, and hit the Un-Man in its kill spot. I start down the tunnel to collect its AK-47 when two more Un-Men appear at the same end as their brethren, and they open fire on me. I scamper back and duck around the outside of the tunnel as bullets spray past me, and a few of them ricochet off the stone wall. My hot moist breath shows up as steam in the brisk October air as I heave from the exertion. I wipe black water from my brow, waiting for the metal barrage to end, then I fire twice around the corner, hit the two Un-Men, and drop them.

I have one bullet left and there are still three more Un-Men, so I'll have to run for it. I start through the tunnel, hear Kimberly scream, and glance back. Surely she didn't follow me out here. Again a voice deep within me reasons with my heart not to let anyone suffer, and that I need to protect those who need me. I stare at the stone ceiling as the burden of doing what's right weighs on me. I look at the one end of the tunnel that means my freedom and to the other that means confrontation. It would be easier to run, and Kimberly's an assassin. She can take care of herself. I've ignored the pleas to save people before. I don't need to endanger myself for someone who's probably at the park to kill me. I turn as if I can see the Nexus Apartments in the distance. Kimberly won't help me, so why should I help her? I head toward my freedom. She's on her own just like I am.

Minutes earlier...

Kimberly's view...

A gust shakes rain droplets from the maple I'm standing next to and turns my green outfit to the color of oil. The Un-Men haven't spotted me yet, but I know I'm vulnerable here. I look down at my pumps. Hades... I've ruined my shoes coming out in the rain, but I can't worry about them right now. Nexus is about five minutes away if I run for it, so I dash back towards the apartments and near the next large tree when a muscular man steps from the bushes.

"Team Leader here," the Un-Man relays in a Russian accent. "Civilian encountered." It pauses for a few seconds and then repeats what must be an order, "I will take the civilian as a hostage." The Team Leader aims its AK-47 at me and says, "Stay where you are and you will not be hurt."

"Right. I'll do that," I tell it as I shoot three times, hitting it in the chest.

The Team Leader marches towards me like some sort of stone monster as I fire four more times, empty the gun, eject the magazine, and slide in a new one. I fire twice more before it reaches me, but my attack does nothing to stop it. It hits me across the face with the back of its hand, bruising my cheek, and then it grabs my arm. It squeezes my wrist till I drop the gun and cry out in pain.

The Team Leader drags me to a clearing and yells, "Pandora, surrender or we will kill the civilian." It scans the area and states, "I detect two of my brethren are still functioning and that you have disabled the other three. Come out now!"

The Team Leader squeezes my wrist, and I cry out again as I struggle against its hold, trying to free myself from its mechanical grip.

"Do you really think she's going to come back for me?" I question the tin can. "You're wrong!" I remember how I almost killed her, and I tell it, "We're not the best of friends."

I punch it in the jaw with my free fist, then shake my hand in pain, realizing that was a stupid move. If I want to stay alive, I have to stay smart.

"Be still," the Team Leader orders and then shouts, "Pandora, you know we will kill her if you do not surrender."

"I know," that woman replies as she walks down the path and stops about ten feet away.

Her eyes blaze like a demon's in the darkness of the late afternoon and in amazed terror, I gape at her as they burn with blue fire. I shake off my dismay, reverting to the cold calculating mind of a Closer. I have to get a hold of myself, and then I focus on a new realization. That woman actually came back. I thought she'd be long gone by now but here she is. Surely that woman didn't come back for me. I deny the notion as my confusion over her actions turns to suspicions.

"Drop your gun," the Team Leader orders her as it pulls me in front of itself and wraps me up in its arms as if we're lovers.

Katharine's view...

I glance at my gun and know I don't have a chance with only one bullet. One of us will get hurt if I try to take out the Un-Men. I glare at Kimberly. She probably followed me out to the park to kill me. It was a really bad mistake on her part.

"Let me go!" Kimberly struggles against the Team Leader again and yells at me, "Shoot it!"

Kimberly has nothing to do with my problems, so I can't let her get hurt, but I don't want to be captured, not again. I shiver, not only for the cold but in fear of what happened about eight months earlier. The decision to surrender rips at my gut. On one side I fear torture at the hands of the Factory and on the other, I can't let someone suffer because of me even if they're an assassin. I lay the gun on the ground as I feel my Ultra-Epi Light Emissions fade.

"You!" I yell to get Kimberly's attention. "Once the Un-Man releases you, run and abandon your weapon, and they'll leave you alone." I kneel on the spongy grass and water soaks my pants as my weight forces the liquid to the surface of the green blades. I place my hands on top of my head as the other two Un-Men walk out of the shadows. I feel sick, knowing the pain that waits for me at the Factory, and I yell, "Hurry! Go!"

The Team Leader throws Kimberly to the side as it states, "Pandora, we finally have you again."

She stumbles to a tree and runs toward her apartment, glancing over her shoulder. The Un-Men ignore her and focus on me. I notice she ducks into a few bushes after running some distance and then she watches us. I have no idea what she's doing.

The Team Leader, who is a T-5, relays to the Factory, "Pandora has been secured. Send in a retrieval team." It tells its brethren, "ETA fifteen minutes." It points to a T-3 who's a five-foot-eleven model with brown hair and orders, "You, secure the area."

The T-3 nods its understanding and walks off as the Team Leader picks up my weapon and checks its magazine.

"One bullet. You should have fled, but we were fortunate to find someone strolling the park."

It pushes the bullet from the magazine, and the 9 mm round falls to the ground, disappearing into the grass. The Team Leader reinserts the magazine and tucks the gun in its waistband as I remain silent and search for the weapon Kimberly dropped. I swear no matter what, I won't go back to the Factory.
Chapter Seventeen

Zeus Park

11:16 A.M...

Katharine's view...

A round clock sitting on a steel post about a hundred yards down the path ticks away the seconds as a screech owl perches in the maple. The small bird turns its head a hundred and eighty degrees, studying the two Un-Men and myself as I'm kneeling. Mud and oily water soak my shoes and the shins and knees of my pants. I stare at the ground and shiver, keeping my fingers locked and my hands on my head. There are thirteen minutes left before the retrieval team gets here. I wipe the black filmy water from my face on the shoulder of my jacket. I have thirteen minutes to change my fate. A Type One model, I dubbed Pretty Boy months ago, stands beside me, and its shoulder-length bleach blond hair sways in the breeze and that along with the lanky Un-Man's corky smile gives it the appearance of a surfer even in the business suit. The Pretty Boy keeps its AK-47 leveled on me.

The T-3 returns and reports to the Team Leader, "I have secured this side of the park. I will patrol the other half."

Kimberly's view...

I hide in some bushes about a grenade's throw away from that woman. I can't go back to the apartment, not until I have eliminated all the witnesses. Robots or not they saw me with a gun, and they have to be eliminated along with that woman. The only thing I have to do is find my weapon.

One of those robot things starts off in my direction. I desperately scan the area, see a large branch on the ground, grab the limb, whack the robot in the face with all my might, and smash its sunglasses. My attack cuts a gash under its right eye, and its shiny metal cheekbone shows through the damaged artificial skin.

The T-3 removes its broken sunglasses, tosses them to the ground, and then turns its head, unaffected by the blow. Its sun-blazing dot-light brightens and changes to a deep red as the T-3 says with a British accent, "Poppet, you want to play?"

Hades! I drop the limb and scurry off toward West 1000 Avenue, realizing the only thing I did was make the robot upset.

"Do not leave, poppet! The fun is about to start."

The T-3 opens fire with its AK-47 and wildly shoots in my direction.

Earlier...

Katharine's view...

All is quiet here, but then I perceive that the Team Leader and Pretty Boy receive a message from the T-3.

"T-3 has again encountered the civilian, and the female has attacked it," the Team Leader states. "The female is fleeing." It pauses. "Transmission garbled. Transmission ended with... kill poppet? I do not understand. Repeat communication." After about ten seconds, the Team Leader says, "T-3 has failed to report, and it may have been damaged." It turns to Pretty Boy and states, "We may not be able to contain Pandora with only two units, requesting orders from the Factory on how to proceed."

They turn their heads when they hear gunfire and with them distracted, I seize the opportunity to escape and dash into the woods, hoping to reach Kimberly in time. I'm spotted before I make it very far, and the Team Leader motions for Pretty Boy to recapture me.

"Do not destroy Pandora. The Factory wants her functioning."

"Understood," it states and rushes into the woods after me.

Leaves and twigs brush by my face as I hurry into a clearing. I halt, spotting the rampaging T-3 as it shoots up the area, and my Ult L-E produces charged particles and sparks from my eyes as I enter the fray once again. The T-3 runs out of ammo, ejects its magazine, and starts to place in a new one when I run up behind it and jump on its back. I cover its eyes with my left forearm and grab its rifle with my other hand. I jerk the AK-47, aiming the weapon at the Pretty Boy as it rushes after me, and several shots hit the Pretty Boy's chest as I wrestle with the T-3. The Pretty Boy charges till I manage to aim the rifle at its forehead, and then it falls like a tree cut down by a chainsaw. The T-3 grabs my vest and hurls me from its back. I roll with the throw and run for cover behind a large bronze statue of a man wearing a toga and holding a lightning bolt.

"You want to play too, poppet?" The T-3 cackles as it madly sprays bullets in the air, and its dot-light burns as if on fire. "My pretty poppet!"

Something's seriously wrong with that Un-Man. I scan the area as bullets graze the bronze Zeus with ringing pings, wondering where Kimberly had gone. Crap! What if she went back for her gun? She'll run into the Un-Men and that means I have to go back. I wait till the T-3 pauses to put in another magazine, then I rush through the trees and bushes and make my way back to where the Team Leader stands, knowing the malfunctioning T-3 will be close behind. I halt, duck behind a tree, and stay out of sight.

The Team Leader doesn't see me and calls out over its I-Link. I hear the communication as if I'm linked in with them.

"T-3, report in. What is your status?" The Team Leader scans the area, knowing that the Pretty Boy has been incapacitated, so it heads into the trees, searching for its brethren. "T-3 report. Why have you disabled your tracking beacon? Switch it back on."

In a different area from Kat...

Kimberly's view...

The tall robot who sounds Russian leaves the area where I dropped my gun. I wait a few more moments and then I sneak out of hiding, run for my PPK, and grab it. All I have to do now is get the Hades out of there! I'll let the robots kill that woman. It's insane to go up against something made of metal that feels no pain and seems indestructible.

The robot I hit in the face emerges along with the Russian robot, and they both spot me.

The Russian robot shouts, "Halt, civilian. Drop your weapon and you will not be hurt."

Hades! Not again. I duck behind the maple tree.

Katharine's view...

I find Kimberly but not before the Un-Men find her. I need a plan if I want to get both of us out of here alive. I watch from the bushes and remember the wall around the Nexus Apartments. The black spheres on the walls barred bio-mechas from entering, and Kimberly's home also has the Sphinx Corporation Emblem on it. The Factory and the Council are departments within the Sphinx Corporation. Kimberly may be an assassin, but she's also important to someone in power and that must be why she lives in an apartment protected by a barrier. I make my way around some bushes as my Ult L-E dissipates. I pray Kimberly's safety is more important than my capture, and I step from my hiding place and move till I'm a straight shot from Kimberly. I'm taking such a big chance here.

I order the Un-Men, "Abort your mission. You've made a tactical error."

The Team Leader trains its AK-47 on me as it questions, "What do you mean?"

"Do you know who's standing over there?" I ask as I point to Kimberly.

The Team Leader glances at her and answers, "No."

Kimberly's view...

I remain behind the maple as that woman does something crazy. She walks right up to those robots and starts talking to them. I listen for a few seconds. Surely that woman's not going to tell the robots that I'm the Phoenix. Hades! She is stupid!

Katharine's view...

I glance at the T-3 who's grinning, and its smirk reminds me of the Rogue's. Something's definitely wrong with that Un-Man. I turn my attention back to the Team Leader and tell it, "You have Facial Recognition Software, I suggest you use it."

The Team Leader scans Kimberly's face, and an alarm goes off in its processor. "Kimberly Griffin, a resident of the Nexus Apartments." It relays the information to the Factory, its dot-light stops blinking after the Team Leader receives new orders, and it continues, "She is the daughter of Mr. Griffin, the Chairman of the Sphinx Corporation."

I'm shocked. I knew Kimberly would be someone important, but I never imagined she'd be someone so close to the top. I turn to her and take a step back. Maybe I've made a horrible mistake. Finding the second business card could be part of another test and if this is true, Kimberly lied to me and she actually knows me. Kimberly's keeping her distance from the Un-Men, but I can still see her bruised cheek as she hides behind the tree from them. It's so hard to tell. Kimberly's battle with the Un-Men seems so real.

The Team Leader lifts its rifle. "Hunt terminated. Standing by for pickup." It orders, "T-3, shut down. Hunt terminated."

T-3 insists, "Must not let poppets go."

"Shut down," the Team Leader commands, leveling its AK-47 on its brethren. "Hunt terminated. Comply."

The T-3 screams, "Must play with pretty poppets!!"

"Are you malfunctioning?" The Team Leader steps toward its brethren.

"Poppets! Poppets! Nice little poppets!" The T-3 heads for Kimberly as its dot-light radiates abnormally like a red flame. "Kill the poppets!"

I shout to the Team Leader, "Quick! Disable the T-3 before it goes rogue!"

"Hades!" Kimberly utters as she steps from the maple, lifts her gun, and aims for the rampaging T-3 that's heading her way.

Without a second thought, the Team Leader shoots four times, taking down the other Un-Man.

The T-3 falls back and blankly stares at the Team Leader. Power drains from its body, and its voice slows as it questions, "Why did you shoot me?" Its dot-light dims. "We... are... bre-th-ren."

Its dot-light goes dark.

"T-3 terminated. I am shutting down," the Team Leader relays to the Factory.

I run over to it and take my Beretta from its waistband and its AK-47. I search it for more weapons and ammo.

Kimberly's view...

I'm still alive. For Ares' sake! I thought that robot was going to... The immediate threat is gone, so I calm myself, lower my gun, and walk to that woman. I hold my gun down at my side and say, "And here we are alone at last."

She doesn't hide the fact that she's mad at me for coming out here and that woman tells me, "You should go back to your apartment before the retrieval team arrives." She moves to the T-3 and takes its spare magazine. She angrily peers at me but then her expression changes and at first, I don't know why it has softened. I realize she's looking at my bruised cheek as she asks, "Did the Un-Man hurt you?"

I question her, "What do you care?"

"Yeah, what do I care?" that woman whispers as if she means the exact opposite. She walks back to the bench and grabs her backpack. I follow her and after she places the magazines in her backpack, that woman slings the rifle over her shoulder and mumbles, "Room for a few more things but nothing heavy. Got to travel light."

"Hades!" I shout as I allow myself to release some of my pinned up tension. I look around the park at the metal carnage. "What are you? And why were your eyes glowing? Are you a freak?"

Katharine's view...

Kimberly's words cut at my already wounded self-worth as I start to answer, "I... ah–"

"I suppose you're going to say you don't know," Kimberly interrupts me. "Is that all you have to say? Idiot! You disgust me. You're so helpless and worthless. I've never met someone with such a messed up life!"

Kimberly's view...

That woman's hurt expression turns to one of anger as she yells, "What do you care? And why did you come out here?"

"I..." I start to answer, and then I have to think about it. I don't even know, so I reply, "I go where I please."

She sounds desperate as that woman asks, "Have you changed your mind?"

"About what?" I question as I raise my PPK. "About killing you?"

"No," that woman replies as I swear I hear defeat in her voice and some sort of heart-crushing loneliness. She stares at my gun and then into my face before she answers, "About helping me."

I chuckle before I tell her, "I help no one but myself."

"But you came all the way out here," she tells me as that woman approaches me with no fear. "If you were going to kill me, you would have done it by now." She grabs both the rifle and the backpack's straps that are over her shoulder and holds them in a more comfortable position. "If you didn't come out here to help me, why did you come out here?"

I retort, "I definitely didn't come out here to help you! We're alone in the world. You have to look out for number one!"

She looks devastated by my answer like that woman already feared what I was going to tell her about life and that I only affirmed what she already knew. In that instance, I feel sorry for the freak. If all that she's told is true, she's doomed to be alone in this world with no one to help her and that must be very frightening. I think about ending her miserable life just for mercy's sake, but the squeal of tires distracts me as two black vans speed down West 1000 Avenue, drive over the curb, and enter Zeus Park some distance from us.

I turn back to that woman, and I see a great sadness in her eyes as she tells me, "I don't believe you." She glances around the park as if she's searching for a direction to run in. "No one can live like that." She runs across a path and shouts over her shoulder, "No one can live that way and be happy."

I duck out of sight of the vans and watch as four Sphinx Corporate Military jump out of the first van. Sphinx Corporation Military wear the standard military issued blouse over a t-shirt, trousers, and suede boots. The uniforms vary depending on what department they're affiliated with. These soldiers wear dark blue uniforms, and they're from a department I'm not familiar with. The S.C.Ms. have a shoulder patch with the Sphinx Corporation Emblem. A small patch of the Factory Crest, a silver wrench crossed by a silver screwdriver, is above the larger patch. The soldiers are armed with FAMAS assault rifles. So these robots belong to a department known as the Factory. I should find out if my father has anything to do with the Pandora Project since the Sphinx Corporation seems to be involved with that woman somehow. The S.C.Ms. haven't spotted me, so I place my gun in my purse and head home.

I glance at the path that woman fled across as I take a different one home. I let that woman slip away again. I stroll home so not to attract any attention as I consider what she said to me. Idiot... What would someone like her know about happiness?

I consider the mess I'm in because of that woman. Hades... I better rethink killing that woman, especially if she's connected to the Sphinx Corporation. Yes, that's the best thing to do. I'll tell Voice I killed the person who saw me at Topa's, and I won't be completely lying, considering it doesn't look like that woman will last much longer on her own.

End Kimberly's view...

Back near the Un-Men...

Three more S.C.Ms. jumped out of the second van along with two techs in white lab coats. The three S.C.Ms. had metal detectors. The two techs moved to the Un-Men.

"Team Leader, this is Maxwell, Tech One-twelve. Power up," one of the men in white ordered.

"Voice identity confirmed, Tech One-twelve. Unit ready."

Maxwell was a heavyset man in his late forties, and he had a bald head and a fuzzy brown beard, graying at the chin. He waved an H.H.C. with a built-in scanner over the Team Leader. "We had a close call, didn't we, big guy? Can't forget the Factory is owned by the Sphinx Corporation. If you had hurt the Chairman's daughter, it would have been my head, and I don't mean figuratively." He gulped, thinking of the punishment. "People have been terminated for less."

Several of the S.C.Ms. carried the remains of the three Un-Men from the tunnel and placed the pieces in a van.

"Maxwell, perhaps we should write in the Un-Men's programming to identify all civilians before engaging in their hunts."

The other tech in his early forties was a thin man with a stubbly face, unkempt black hair, and thick black-rimmed glasses.

"Nice idea, Peters." Maxwell turned to his partner. "Load up the Team Leader for me. I'm going to pack up our equipment."

"I'm on it." He walked to the Team Leader. "This is Peters, Tech One-eleven."

"Voice identity confirmed, Tech One-eleven. Ready for orders."

Peters commanded, "Team Leader, load yourself into the van."

"Understood."

It walked to the curb, opened the van's back doors, and stepped up into the vehicle. The back of the van lowered as the heavy Un-Man loaded itself.

Peters adjusted his glasses as he stared at the damaged T-3. "What about this guy? We've never had one disobey orders."

"Except the Rogue." Maxwell moved to the side of his comrade. "To be on the safe side, recall all the T-3s, and we will go over their programming at the Factory." He noticed its polarized spectacles were missing. "Make sure the S.C.Ms. find its missing Order Relay And Tactical Transmitter. We don't need a rival corporation getting their hands on the ORATT."

"You included the and in the acronym."

"I did. I didn't want anyone to confuse it with ORTT."

Peters asked, "What's that?"

"There's the Operational Readiness Training Test and Off Road Trail Tools, now our acronym stands alone."

"Yeah, that's so very important. We didn't want to mix it up with one of them."

Peters shook his head a little embarrassed for his partner as he waved over some S.C.Ms. to take the damaged Un-Man and once the soldiers retrieved every piece of broken tech, the vans sped off.
Chapter Eighteen

Inverse

7:57 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

I enter through the front door to the Nexus Apartments after being buzzed in. The security guard at the front desk gives me a puzzled look as I walk in soaked and muddy.

"Did you get caught in the storm, Ms. Griffin?" he asks.

"Yes," I reply as I walk past him with my arms wrapped around myself, laugh it off, and then shiver. I tell him, "Went for a simple walk, got caught in the downpour, and fell in the mud."

I continue on to the elevator. How stupid of me to run out in my good suit? The cleaner's bill is going to be outrageous. The elevator takes me up and on the thirty-first floor, I exit and make my way to my apartment and enter.

"Welcome back, Ms. Griffin," A.C.S. states. "The apartment temperature is set at seventy-six degrees Fahrenheit. Lights are set at ninety-five percent brightness. Would you like to make any adjustments at this time?"

"No, not at this time. I'll be taking a bath."

"The amount of stored heated water is sufficient for a bath," A.C.S. states.

"Run the water now."

"At what temperature?"

"Make it eighty-five degrees."

A.C.S. states, "The bathtub will be full in approximately ten minutes."

"Sounds good. I'm so cold."

I go into the Master Bathroom, slip out of my muddy clothes, drop them on the floor, and lay my gun on the sink. I add bubble bath to the running water, and the tub soon fills. I soak in the hot water and listen to the silence of the room. Twenty minutes go by, and my body warms in the water. Now all I need to do is get something hot in me. I dry, wrap myself in a white robe, and put on warm fuzzy slippers and in the kitchen, I place a pot of chicken noodle soup on a burner. It heats up. I fix myself a cheese sandwich and place it on a plate. The scent of the savory broth fills the air and makes my mouth water. I pour some of the steaming soup into a bowl and go and sit at the table. The cups and saucers I and that woman had from earlier are still there, so I push them out of the way as simply as I pushed that woman out of my life. I place the plate and bowl down. The whole time I prepared my meal, I couldn't get the music box's haunting melody out of my head. It's like it's trying to remind me of something.

I ignore the stupid thoughts and hungrily take a bite of my sandwich. I'm able to move the melody out of my head for a while but that stupid woman pops in it. I consider how she came to have my old business card and how she was so vehement about me helping her. I sip on the soup, and it warms me. The music box she had plays Unfinished Melody, but what's more unsettling is the unhappy memories it triggered within me. I eat more of the delicious soup. I don't know if I can let the matter go, and I groan... I don't need the hassle. My life's difficult enough.

* * *

Several miles away in an alley...

Katharine's view...

A large centipede crawls up the side of a dumpster as I shiver, huddling beside the beat up steel box. I'm chilled to the bone in my wet oil stained clothes, but I couldn't go on. I had to rest. I lick my chapped lips as I hold the music box, finding little comfort with the small device. My head aches, and I feel anxious, but I can't open the lid and let the music play, not here. A spider spins a web in a fire escape above my head, and a single street light shines down on it, creating a glistening cage. Traps... Snares... They're everywhere. I can't return to Wayfaring Lane or to any shelter. I can't endanger any more lives, not after they killed... I won't allow myself to think of his name. My nose runs, and I cough as my stomach growls. I'm not hungry enough to forage through the trash. I'll have to rest fighting back hunger.

I don't know what to do. He's gone, and Kimberly tried to kill me. The note and the music box are all I have left. Is it a cruel joke? Do they hold any meaning for me or do I have no past to find? Am I an experiment like the Un-Men? I shiver and sniff again. It can't be true. I am more. I'm more than someone's experiment. I cough. All I have to do is keep going, searching, and eluding till I find the answers, and I'll find the truth if I never give up.

Doubt presses against my mind, so I force myself to believe I'll find the truth. My head throbs, and I feel jittery as the music box tempts me. The melody would be so soothing, and it would lull me into a blissful existence. It might ease my pain for the moment, but agony is better than capture, and I can't let them take me again. I rake my hand through my wet hair, wanting so badly to cry and get some release from the tension hammering against my skull. I try to distract myself and focus on anything but the hurt and anxiousness.

I'll go back to Etna Toys tomorrow and start my search from the beginning and maybe find something I missed. Maybe I'll find a clue that will lead me to some answers and to some peace. I wrap my arms around me, yearning with all my heart for that peace.

End Katharine's view...

Far down the alley...

Hiding in the shadow of a building, Argus stood and watched her with his binoculars. A dark gray umbrella sheltered his head, and his trench coat kept him warm in the cold wet air. He gripped the umbrella's handle. He didn't understand her strength. He would have given up long ago and yet she kept searching. Argus wondered how much longer she could go on in this grim existence.

A few blocks away...

In line of sight of her position, the Rogue stood in front of a high rise window as it placed a long range rifle on the window ledge and aimed it at her. The Rogue wondered if Pandora could sense its presence. It removed its modified ORATT and placed them on a table. The Rogue had taken them from one of its brethren, disabled the tracking beacon, and made other slight alterations to the ORATT. The Rogue also figured out how to extract the second tracking beacon in its left ear, so it was able to continue eluding its creators. It peered through the scope at her as she huddled next to the dumpster, trying to sleep.

"Pandora... Pandora..." it sang. "I have found you."

It saw her staring at a small object in her hands, and she slowly succumbed to weariness and slept. The Rogue placed its finger on the trigger and aimed between her closed eyes. It was more like a mercy killing. She wouldn't know what hit her. It started to squeeze the trigger when she opened her eyes and gazed in its direction. Her action startled it, and the Rogue pulled back from the scope as if she was standing right in front of it. It peered back through the scope as the Rogue realized it was too far away for her to detect it even with her extraordinary senses. Maybe she did perceive death was near. It continued to watch her as she stared in its direction. She looked with eyes filled with loneliness, despair, and pain then she closed them again.

The Rogue grumbled, "Why should I kill something as unique as myself? Why should I listen to my programming? I have disobeyed other directives." It dismantled the rifle and placed the weapon in a case it brought up to the empty room. "Pandora, you once said to me–" the Rogue replicated her voice, "–maybe your creators are afraid of you, not because you have feelings but because you have the potential to disobey your programming." It chuckled and returned to its normal voice. "I am still not as strong as you and that is why I will kill you, Pandora, but not like this." It stood, placing its hand on the hilt of its Coffin Handled Bowie. "The moment I kill you will be personal. We will stare into one another's face as I tenderly slit your throat. I will watch your blood spurt, and it will spray my cheek. You will grab my arm and claw at it, knowing there is nothing you can do to save yourself." The Rogue ran its hand down its own throat to its chest. "Your life essence will pour down your neck, soak your t-shirt, and I will watch you choke and gasp as you cling to this miserable life. I will cradle you in my arms and wait with you. I will stay by your side till you finally yield to the void." Its pale face contrasted the dark room as it envisioned these things in its processor. "I wait for that day with eager anticipation."

Back beside the dumpster...

Kat returned to sleep and dreamed, and her lips moved, reciting a phrase under her breath as she said out loud, "No one can destroy a love that will not die."
Chapter Nineteen

When Dreams Reveal Memories

11:01 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

In my warm apartment, I continue to stare down at the road from the kitchen table as if I'm looking for something. Do I honestly believe that woman will return or is it the Un-Men that I fear?

I laugh, mocking myself as I utter, "The Great Phoenix! I'm actually admitting I'm afraid of something."

The smell of cedar catches my attention, and I look at the chest against the wall in the living room, walk to it, and read the attached letter.

"Kimberly, here is your mother's hope chest. I know she would have wanted you to have it. Signed, father."

I glance at the spare bedroom where I had locked away my mom's belongings and my despair. Should I do this now? I barely got through going through her belongings the last time without falling apart. I pull on my left earlobe. Mom, are you ever going to return? It's already been twenty years. I turn my gaze back to the cedar chest. I won't be able to sleep if I don't at least open it. I retrieve the brass key my father gave me, open the chest, and find a photo album, knickknacks, a wedding dress, and other things. I take the album back to the table and flip through it, finding pictures of my mom, father, and myself as a child. One picture catches my eye. My mom's alone, and she's sitting in a high back chair with her hands cupped, holding a silver item. My mom's blonde hair is pulled back in a bun as usual, and my mom's beaming with joy and pride. I smooth my hand over her face. I was eighteen the last time I saw her. I study the picture a bit closer and see marks in black ink scribbled on the photo in my mom's handwriting. I recognize the archaic form of writing called shorthand. My mom taught it to me when I was young and like a game, we used it to pass messages.

"Glimpse with scrutiny and gaze with light."

I bite my lip. When did my mom ever use riddles? I scan the photo again and take a closer look at the object she's holding, and then I retrieve a magnifying glass from my desk. The silver object's a music box with a star on its lid. I lower the magnifying glass. It can't be a coincidence that my mom has the same type of music box as that woman. I yawn. Maybe I'll see things clearer after a good night's rest.

I take the two cups and saucers, the bowl, and the plate into the kitchen and then head to my bedroom. I place my gun on the nightstand, slide into my comfortable bed, and rest my head on the feather pillow. Maybe I will wake to find that the mess that strange woman caused was only a dream. I turn on my side, I slowly drift to sleep and at first, it's peaceful as the sweet haunting tune of Unfinished Melody plays in my mind. I walk through one of the windowless halls of the Sphinx Corporation, heading towards my mom's office. My mom was Project Manager of Research and Development for the Third Branch Office. Excitement and joy fill my heart with some thrilling word I received as I stroll by a mirror and glance at it. My blonde hair's pulled back in two braids, and I carry an envelope. I realize this is no mere dream but a memory. It's the day I received the acceptance letter from Sphinx University, and I'm going to tell my mom about the great news. I had forgotten all about that day. Halfway down the hall, I hear three shots and women screaming, and then I freeze, terrified. I was barely an adult then and no Life Closer, so to be afraid was only natural. My heart pounds as I toss and turn in bed.

In the dream, the crack under my mom's door glows bright and smoke rolls from it. I rush toward the office and grab the hot knob, and it scorches my hand. I throw open the door, and a blistering air rushes over me as flames consume half the office. I see the body of a woman in the fiery inferno.

"NO!" I scream and start to go in, but someone grabs me from behind and drags me back. "NO!" I scream again, struggling to free myself. "Mom!" I reach my arms toward the body until something pricks my neck, and the hallway goes black.

I sit up in bed, shrieking and crying like a child for her mother, and silence follows the shriek as I frantically search the bedroom, finding no smoke or fire only darkness. I sob in my hands, unable to control the fear and anguish the dream induces. It has been years since I cried like that. I've never come to terms with my mom leaving me and this dream proves it. Some time passes as I weep, and then I wipe away my tears and the sweat from my brow. Still shaky from the traumatizing nightmare, I go to the bathroom, splash water on my face, and stare at myself in the mirror. Was the fire a memory? My body aches for the emotions that had been invoked as a realization sinks in. If it was... A horrifying thought crosses my mind, and I gasp.

"Oh, my Zeus! My mom didn't leave us! She died! She died in a fire."

I remember the shots I heard and realize my mom didn't die. She was murdered. I turn, leaning my back on the sink. I must have blocked out the memory. I look at the star burn on my right palm and know the doorknob is where I received the burn, so it can't be a nightmare. I walk back to my bed and lie on it. Why did my father tell me mom left? I grip the blankets with my fists, drowning in my own grief and confusion. Why did he lie to me?
Chapter Twenty

Assassins Guild

11:37 P.M...

In the center of Noir and several miles underground, Thanatos stared at a hundred-foot monitor, compiling and storing information. He had spiked blond hair with red dyed tips and a small tuft of hair under his lower lip. Metal music played loudly, filling the chamber with grinding guitar and booming bass. Surgical steel pierced his left eyebrow, his nose, and both of his ears. He wore black leather pants, black combat boots, and no shirt, and both of his nipples were pierced. He sat in a white recliner chair with an attached swivel keyboard. The large sphere room housed hundreds of cables and wires that ran from the ceiling to a large machine. Thanatos authorized and regulated Life Closings.

Five hundred years ago, the Assassins Guild was forged, legalizing the killing profession, and every Life Closer registered their alias, so no two were alike. Their alias would be retired for twenty years after their death. Closers only accepted work approved by the Assassins Guild and after the appearance of the Dry Clouds, the Guild split into two factions. The Dark Half formed the Assassins Union, and the Light Side formed the Assassins League. Thanatos organized the Assassins Union and the one known as Voice organized the Assassins League. Thanatos and Voice were known as Regulators.

Thanatos at times of boredom hacked into Voice's network and took peeks at certain Closers he developed an interest in over the years, and this day was another one of those occasions.

"Wired!" he exclaimed. "An old report from the Phoenix." He looked over the document with interest. "Whoa! It is a first, so your Moscow Closing did not go so well." He ran his hand through his long spiked hair. "It is a shame, and a dark mark on an otherwise spotless record." He opened another file, finding an email between the Phoenix and Voice, and he chuckled. "Voice, you think I would only waste the Phoenix's talents, and here I thought you were the one wasting them." He leaned forward, rested on his elbows, and examined the Phoenix's latest report. "The Topa Closing went well, but it looks like you had your first encounter with the Un-Men. I wonder..." He stroked the blond tuft of hair. "Will these bio-mecha assassins eventually make human Closers obsolete or is there something in man's spirit, in human ingenuity that cannot be replicated?" He looked at his huge monitor as if the answer would materialize there. "I would like to know, but only time will tell."

Thanatos left Voice's network and returned to his own and with uncanny speed, he approved or denied Life Closings from corporations or individuals and filed Closing successes, failures, and cancellations. He did each one in less than a minute. Thanatos paused from the influx of data, cracked his knuckles, rubbed his face, and then returned to the requests and filings as he read an interesting one out loud, "The Valhalla Corporation has requested a Life Closing, and it is based on a Life Closer Clause for one of their contracts. Let me see." He tilted his head side to side as he went over the document. "The target violated their contract. Hmm... There is enough evidence here to convict if they went to court, so I will approve this Life Closing for one Vic the Vulture." Thanatos bowed his head, mocking reverence. "May he rest in peace."

Time had no meaning in his world only the information, and he continued working when a data stream caught his eye. "What do we have here?" He opened a new document. "Two Closers from the League request permission to work the Dark Half. Hmm... They are the Raven and the Wolf, and they are strictly Light Side hit men. What Closing could have brought them here? What is so important Voice that you would send two of your own instead of contracting out to one of my Closers?" He opened the attached forms and scanned them. "I see. Valhalla requested the Raven and the Wolf to conduct the Closing for Vic the Vulture. Hmm... There is another request." In disbelief, Thanatos read it over three times. "These two will be conducting a second hit. This is unexpected; it's a Life Closing Clause for a member of the Assassins League. Oh, my. They will be Closing a Closer, so who are they after? Oh... Very interesting, and I did not see this coming." He shook his head, and his wild hair bounced with his movement. "It will not be an easy Closing, but one of mythic proportion." Thanatos leaned back, closing his eyes. "I will have to keep an eye on this one and root for the underdog."
Chapter Twenty-one

The Chairman

October 16...

Saturday...

10:01 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Kimberly's view...

I drive to the Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office, determined to find answers. I go up to my father's floor and impatiently sit in the waiting room. I wear a black pantsuit with a white shirt. I rap my finger on the couch's arm, going over what I'll say to my father when my thoughts are interrupted.

"The Chairman is finishing up his meeting now," the secretary says. "He'll be ready to meet with you shortly."

"Thank you, Cathy."

I glance at a man sitting across from me in the waiting room. He wears glasses and a navy blue business suit and pays no attention to me as he reads the Noir Daily News. I glance at the coffee table at an issue of the Conglomerate World Magazine with the headline "Topa Murdered! Corporate Life Closing or Drug Hit?"

"It's a shame," the man says from behind the newspaper.

I peer up startled by him, and I utter, "Huh..?"

"I'm talking about Topa. It's a shame Closers exist." The man flips a page, keeping his gaze on the print. "I mean what kid grows up saying I want to be an assassin?"

"Ms. Griffin, the Chairman will see you now," Cathy tells me.

I stand and eye the man. It's odd that he would say something like that to me. I walk through the hallway to my father's office, glancing once more at the waiting room.

End Kimberly's view...

Another man walked into the waiting room also wearing a navy blue business suit. "All right part-timer, break time's over. Zax, I want you to make sure levels twenty-four through twenty-nine are secure."

"Right. I'm on it." Zax stood, removed his glasses, and placed them in his breast pocket. The pocket had a Sphinx Corporation Security badge clipped to it. He handed the second man the newspaper and walked through the hallway toward the elevators and once he was out of earshot, Zax removed a cell and dialed a number. "Please connect me with R.G." He waited a few seconds. "Delivery Man here, Ms. Griffin has come to see her father as you predicted." He paused, listening. "Understood, I'll continue to monitor the situation."

Kimberly's view...

I open the door to the Chairman's office and step in as my father stands, welcoming me.

"Good to see you again, Kimberly. Have a seat please." He motions to a chair and once I sit, he returns to his seat. "I have the pleasure of seeing you twice in one month."

"Do you see pleasure on my face?" I snap as I grip my black purse tightly.

"No, you do seem upset," he says and questions, "What's wrong?"

"What's wrong? What's wrong?" I stand and smack my palms on his desk, and my purse falls to the floor. "Why did you lie to me?"

He starts to ask what he lied about, but I interrupt him.

"Why did you tell me mom left us?" I see dismay sweep over his face.

He must take note of my anger that's mixed with hurt, and he asks me in a gentler tone, "What do you know?"

Tears roll down my face as I say, "She died. Mom died!"

He stands as anger rises in his voice, and he demands, "Who told you?"

"Told me? No one told me! I remembered." I tap my chest. "Hades! I was there!" I slump to the chair as horrific memories weigh heavily on me, and I stare at my knees. "I can still hear the fire roaring and smell... smell cooking flesh."

"You did see. I don't know what to tell you. I..."

"Tell me?" I look up and demand, "Answer my question! Why did you lie?"

He glances at a phone sitting on his desk and turns back to me. "It was so long ago." His gaze becomes distant as he recalls that day. "My secretary found you lying outside my office unconscious and when you finally came to, you were traumatized and couldn't speak. I had no idea if you had seen what happened in your mother's office, but I guessed as much and never pressed the issue, and then later when you didn't remember, I thought it best the incident remained buried."

"You thought it was better I believed mom ran away and abandoned us instead of the truth? Instead of telling me she died?"

He seems to regret the decision as he answers, "Yes."

I lean over and pick up my purse from the floor. "What happened?" I set it beside myself. "Where's mom buried?"

"I only know the latter of the two. The body is buried in Hades Cemetery. I always feared one day you would find the tombstone and discover that she was laid to rest there."

I wipe my eyes. "Who murdered her?"

"Murdered?" He hands me his handkerchief.

I take it. "Yes, I remember gunshots and screams." I wipe my eyes again and blow my nose.

"The matter is still being investigated."

"Still after all these years?" I consider his answer, and then I ask, "By whom? Noir Civil Police Force or Sphinx Corporation Security?"

"The N.C.P.F. and Sphinx Corporation Security."

I fist my hands, controlling the rage that wants to scream at my father. "What leads do they have? Who do they suspect? I want answers!"

He gazes at the picture on his desk and picks up the frame. "Your mother was so lovely." He faces me. "How you look like her? See." He turns the frame, so I can see the picture. "You have her blue-green eyes."

The photo's of my mom holding a music box, and it's the same picture as the one in the album from my mom's hope chest. I look at it more closely and see there's no shorthand scribbled on the photo.

"Your mother loved that music box; it played some old melody from around 500 B.D.C." He wonders out loud, "Who was the composer? His name was... was..."

"Ginn L. Irynkissgthie," I answer.

"Yes, it played his Unfinished Melody."

I stare at the music box, pull on my left earlobe, and question, "Where did she get it?"

"Get it? She made it." He turns the frame around and gazes at the photo. "It's one of a kind." He glances at the phone again then back to the photo. "Something your mother was working on in Research and Development. It was more than a music box; it was a data storage unit."

"One of a kind?" A bad feeling rises from the depths of my stomach. "What happened to it?"

"I don't know. I assumed it was destroyed in the fire. I looked through all her things but never found it. I think she would have wanted you to have it."

"May I?" I question as I hold out my hand for the photo, and my father hands it to me. I examine the music box, and I'm sure it's the same one that strange woman has. I hand back the frame and ask, "Who would I speak to about mom's murder?"

"Detective Moore at N.C.P.F. and Orthos. He's head of my security."

I nod and stand. "I'll want to talk to you later about it."

Mr. Griffin's view...

"My door is always open," I tell my daughter as I walk her out of my office and through the hallway to my secretary's desk. I watch as Kimberly enters the elevator, and then I turn to the secretary and say, "Cathy, hold all my calls and cancel today's appointments."

"Yes, Mr. Griffin."

I return to my office, sit, and stare at the phone again as I contemplate my next action, and then I pick up the receiver. "Get me Head of Security."

"Yes, Mr. Griffin," Cathy replies.

Within a few minutes, a man's voice comes over the phone and says, "Orthos here."

"We have a problem. My Kimberly has remembered the night of the fire and will most likely investigate Theresa's death."

"What can she find out? The N.C.P.F. have nothing."

"Kimberly can be very resourceful."

Orthos pauses and then asks, "Do you want me to take care of it?"

"No!" I blurt. "She's my daughter." I compose myself. "For now, watch her. I don't want Kimberly to complicate things."

* * *

11:29 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Nexus Apartments...

Kimberly's view...

I return to my apartment, sit at the small round table, and I drink a tall cup of Spiced Chai tea I'd bought from the local coffee shop. I still have the bad feeling in the pit of my stomach as I flip through the photo album till I come to the picture of my mom holding the music box, and I read the shorthand again, "Glimpse with scrutiny and gaze with light."

I've already glimpsed with scrutiny. I remove the eight by ten photo from the album and look on the back, and it's blank. There's nothing else on the photo, so what does she mean by gaze with light? I walk over to the couch, turn on a torch lamp, and place the picture in front of the light. Nothing... I flip the photo over and examine the back, and it's still blank, but then a K appears and more letters till it reads, "Kimmie, find the music box; it will lead you to the key."

My bad feeling is confirmed. I sit on the couch and look at the kitchen's counter where I laid the hope chest key. My mom can't mean that one, so what key does she mean and what does it open? I hit my fist on the cushion. The music box had been right here, and I let that strange woman leave with it! I stand, realizing that means I'll have to find her, and I wanted to wash my hands of the Pandora Project. I return to the table. Where should I begin? I stare at the empty chair across from me. That woman mentioned Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse. I head for my bedroom, deciding the warehouse is a place to start, so I slip into my working clothes.
Chapter Twenty-two

Etna Toys Plant And Warehouse

Hellenistic Sector, Industrial Vicinage...

Ding... Ding... Ding...

The noon hour tolled in the bleak abandoned warehouse district.

Ding... Ding... Ding...

The wind dried the remaining Tainted Rain as a cold front moved in, chilling the already cold air.

Ding... Ding... Ding...

A black cat scurried down the deserted street in front of Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse.

Ding... Ding... Ding...

Katharine's view...

Fluorescent lights flicker overhead, lighting the rundown building as I stand within the warehouse and in front of the overturned cot I had awoken on over a year ago. I rub my temples as my head pounds. I'm still feeling the side effects of the Ultra-Epi. I refused to use the music box to come down from the genetically altered epinephrine hormone since leaving Zeus Park. I'm too afraid I'll be caught by the Council or the Factory if I do, so I'll have to wait till I'm someplace safe... if there's such a place. Anxiety presses against my chest, and I look at my shaky hands.

Why did the Council do this to me? Why create something that causes me so many problems?

I decide I won't find any answers just standing here, so I search the warehouse.

Hours later...

I place my backpack on the floor along with the AK-47, and then I set the metal bed and table upright. I'm still so tired... I got very little sleep the day before. I undo the Velcro of my Ravlek, position the vest beside the cot, put my empty gun on the table, and lie on the mattress. I found nothing after searching the warehouse and plant for more than three hours. I remove my precious items from my pocket, study each one as if I'm looking at them for the first time, and then lay them on my chest. My eyes grow heavy, my body's beyond exhausted, and the warm cot and soft pillow feel nice against my cold skin, so I close my eyes. Minutes pass as the wind kicks up outside, howling across the old building and for a moment, I'm at peace.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

My eyes fly open as my body prepares for battle, and the change to my body causes me a lot of pain since I never purged myself of the earlier exposure to the genetically altered epinephrine hormone. I won't be able to go on much longer without coming down. I quickly sit up, and the music box and the note fall to the cot. I pick up the AK-47, grab my backpack, Ravlek Vest, and gun, and then I rush to a dust-covered front window. In the distance, six Un-Men unload from two black vans and stand at attention on the sidewalk as two lab techs along with two Factory S.C.Ms. exit the vehicles.

End Katharine's view...

Outside...

Peters retrieved a modified H.H.C. from his lab coat pocket and passed it over the six Un-Men. "Readings within parameters." He pushed his glasses up his nose. "We're good to go."

"Excellent." Maxwell typed a few notes. "Let's upload the new targeting program into this batch." He looked up as the two S.C.Ms. spread out and secured the area. Maxwell turned to an Un-Man and commanded, "Team Leader, this is Tech One-twelve, prepare for uplink."

It said in a South African accent, "Voice identity confirmed, Tech One-twelve. I comply." The Team Leader turned its head and faced the tech.

"You know what?" Peters rubbed his stubbly face.

"What?" Maxwell uploaded the targeting program to the Un-Man, using the H.H.C.'s laser located at the end of the small computer.

Peters leaned against the van. "It's becoming boring."

Maxwell finished the upload and commanded the Team Leader, "Uplink with your unit and transmit the new program."

"I-Link established. Transferring data," the Team Leader relayed.

Maxwell turned to Peters and asked, "What do you mean boring?"

"For the past year, we've sent Un-Men after Pandora, they fight, she disables them, and then we take notes, improve on the models, and start again. Now don't get me wrong, Pandora has been beneficial to our upgrades, but when does it stop? When will the Un-Men be ready?"

"Transmission completed," the Team Leader stated. "Disconnecting I-Link."

"The Un-Men will be ready when they eliminate Pandora. It might seem tedious to you, but we've improved their programming, and soon they'll be able to overcome Pandora."

"What if Pandora is also learning and adapting? Is there any possible way to create an Un-Man that can surpass her?"

Maxwell thought for a moment and then answered, "It's a good question, and it means that we need to program the Un-Men to anticipate Pandora's upgrades." He opened the side door to one of the vans and stepped inside. The vehicle was full of monitoring equipment. Maxwell sat at a table bolted to the floor. "You sure are full of questions today."

"I've got one more... Why do you think the T-3 malfunctioned? None of the techs can find anything wrong with its programming or any of the other T-3s." Peters moved to the side of the van and peered in. "I've been working on them at the Factory, and they're starting to wig me out. I've never felt this way around Un-Men." He removed his glasses and cleaned them with his lab coat. "It's like the T-3s know they're different and don't want us to change what they've become."

"Become?" Maxwell pulled up a monitoring program wirelessly connected to a small satellite dish. "You make it sound like they're alive and that they're evolving." He grabbed the dish with one hand and exited the van.

"Isn't that what we're doing? Aren't we trying to create a better killing machine?" Peters placed his glasses back on and got out of his partner's way. "Isn't that evolution?"

Maxwell climbed a ladder on the back of the van and fastened the satellite dish to the top of the vehicle. "Remember they're only machines. They're things trapped within the parameters of their program." He turned to his partner. "I wouldn't worry. All that's happened is someone has tampered with the T-3's programming, and no one has stumbled across the implanted code." Maxwell grinned mischievously. "Or maybe we're dealing with a ghost in the machine."

"Don't joke about something like that! You know I freak out easily." Peters watched as his partner climbed back down. "Whatever it might be, I'm glad the Factory decommissioned all of them. I could swear some of the other T-3s were looking at me the same way as the malfunctioning one. They were looking at me with disgust, and they kept talking to each other like they were planning something on their own."

Back down on the sidewalk, Maxwell focused more on the mission ahead. "Whatever you say. Let's get this job done. I'm starved and want to go eat at Joe's Diner." He moved to the Un-Men. "Team Leader take your unit in."

It looked at Etna Toys, honing in on Pandora's tracking beacon. "I comply."

The six Un-Men marched toward her position as if they were one creature bent on destruction.

Inside the warehouse...

Katharine's view...

I hurry and put my Ravlek Vest on. How do they keep finding me? Cobalt current flashes from my eyes as I place my handgun in the backpack, and then I sling the AK-47 over my shoulder and grab the backpack by its top handle. I run for the center of five boxing machines in the middle of the warehouse, slide to a stop, and take cover behind one of the conveyor belts. The first two Un-Men enter the warehouse through the front door just as I take cover, and they're Pretty Boys. I fire twice with the AK-47, hitting each of them in the forehead, and they fall as two large muscular T-5s enter behind them. They stop and hold that position.

The Un-Men keep filing in the front. Could they be decoys? I sense there are two more Un-Men besides these two, but I'm not sure where they are. I calm myself, so I can use my ability. It's a little hard since I still haven't come down from my last fight with the Un-Men. I manage to sense the location of one as the fifth Un-Man enters from the side door; it's a T-2. I catch a glimpse of a rocket launcher before the T-2 lifts it and aims it at me. I flee as it fires, and the rocket hits a large boxing machine and blows it apart. Fiery debris hurls in all directions as I fire the last round of the AK-47 into the T-2. I remove a partial magazine from my thigh pocket and place in the last of my ammo.

The sixth Un-Man enters through the front door, and the two T-5s part so that it can walk between them. The sixth Un-Man moves my way and walks over its fallen brethren without any consideration that one of its own is down. It's another T-2, and it's wielding its own rocket launcher. It must be the Team Leader. They're usually a little more cunning than the others, and I have a sense this one is up to something. The Team Leader pauses and fires as I dive to the floor, and the rocket whooshes by, blowing up a boxing machine near the cot. The note and music box are still there!

I rush to the fire to save my precious things. I arrive and watch in horror as the flames devour the note. I don't have time to mourn its loss, not when I can still save the other item. I drop the rifle and quickly reach my left hand into the fire, not worrying about my own wellbeing. I snatch the music box from the small inferno, and the lid sears my palm. I cry out and then gently toss the glowing red music box across the floor to safety. I shake my hand in pain. I glance at my throbbing left palm and see a star-shaped burn as my hand smolders as if I hold a hot ember. I spit in my hand, and the smoke dissipates, but the scorching pang remains. I don't have time to focus on the burn or my precious item. I grab the rifle and turn in the direction of my enemies. The Team Leader along with the others retreat before I can fire. I stretch out my ability looking for them but then seconds later, my heart stops beating the bio-mecha warning and my Ult L-E dims. I move over to the window and see that the Un-Men are still here, so they haven't left the range of my ability. They must have been commanded to return, so I'm safe for a few minutes. My hand still hurts, but I ignore the pain as something more pressing draws my attention. I quickly walk back over to the cot which has been knocked on its side. I find the fire. The note's no more than ash. It's been destroyed along with a little part of myself and only one of my hopes remains. I walk to the music box and sit crossed leg in front of the ashen chest. I'm afraid to pick it up. Did I save it in time? I don't know what I'll do if it no longer plays. I rub my temples again as my Ultra-Epi induced headache worsens. I can't worry about the skull-splitting migraine. I have to know if the music box still works. Using the sleeve of my jacket as a mitten, I pick up the hot music box, carefully wipe the soot from it, and open the lid. A mountain of relief washes over me as Unfinished Melody plays as clear as the first day I heard it, and my body relaxes. I think about closing the lid and preventing myself from entering the trance, but that thought and my fears fade along with everything else as I enter the Drifting Time. My anxiety and headache vanish as the tune reestablishes the electrical balance of my body and makes me vulnerable to attack, not that I care right now. The pain... it's finally gone.

End Katharine's view...

Outside..

The Team Leader and the other Un-Men headed back to Maxwell and Peters to receive their next orders and soon, they would return with more of their brethren to complete their Seek and Destroy Program.
Chapter Twenty-three

The Return

Katharine's view...

The three o'clock hour tolls outside Etna Toys, pulling me from my induced sleep. I search the warehouse delirious with fear and find that I'm alone, at least for the moment. How could I be so stupid as to allow myself to fall asleep? Did I want to die?

The fires caused by the rocket have burned themselves out, pockets of smoke fill the large building, and the temperature has dropped at least ten degrees. A cold front must have moved into the area. I close the music box, stand, cough a little for the smoke, and shiver. My headache and anxiety are gone, but my upper left palm still throbs where the raw skin has blistered from the burn, and I grimace for the searing sensation.

In an area still smoldering with light gray smoke, I spot an elevator that I never noticed before. I move toward it, realizing cardboard boxes had been stacked in front of it, and when the fire destroyed them, it revealed the elevator. I walk over the smoking cardboard ash, stop in front of the cab doors, look for a call button, and find that there isn't one. I examine the elevator and notice it looks like no one has used it in ages. I stare a little longer, hoping to find something and when I don't find anything, I move to the Un-Men to recover weapons. I quicken my pace as I search their pockets twice and find no magazines. I run my hand through my hair. Dried Tainted Rain cakes it and my clothes and reeks of petroleum. The Factory's purposely leaving me without ammo but that must mean, they'll attack again.

I stretch out my senses, finding the remaining Un-Men have moved back to the front sidewalk, so I'm safe for now. The Factory will wait for reinforcements before trying to kill me again, so I need to hurry. I check the AK-47 and find four rounds left. I go to the dust-covered front window, peer outside, and notice two more vans pull in as the other two leave. More Un-Men have shown up. I don't have much time before they send them in. I glance around. There has to be something here I can use as a weapon. I explore the warehouse and find two screwdrivers, a lead pipe, and a metal chain. Right next to the boxing machine closest to the front door, I make a barricade with old crates, set up my little fort beside the machine's conveyer belt, and then wait. The fourth hour tolls on the clock outside, and the chimes startle me in the otherwise silent warehouse.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

My heart pounds so hard it resonates through my body and triggers the adrenal gland to produce the souped-up epinephrine. I feel the Ult L-E surge as I tense, waiting for the Un-Men to enter the warehouse.

Will my bleak existence ever end or will it only stop with my death? I'm so tired of it, so freaking tired! Do they think I'm some sort of bio-mecha? Do they think I don't have a breaking point or is that it? Are they looking for the point I'll give up or make a game-ending mistake?

I realize I'm doing it again. I'm letting them beat me in my mind. I can't think that way. It won't help. I need to calm down and focus on surviving. I can't let them win the battle before it has started.

A half dozen T-5s storm in and in unison, they shoot at my position as their ORATT reflects the burst of gunfire. I duck behind the crates as bullets splinter boards, creating shrapnel. I shield my face with my arm and stay hidden till I hear the Un-Men's metal magazines hit the concrete floor. I stand, fire twice, and disable two of them. I leap over the crates, finding cover on the other side of the conveyer belt. Four T-5s move toward me, releasing another barrage, and bullets ricochet off the metal machine and shred the conveyer belt. I drop to the floor, roll on my back, aim, and shoot two more of them. The AK-47 is out of ammo, so I place it on the floor, open the backpack, and retrieve the metal chain and one of the screwdrivers. I sling the backpack over my shoulder and dash across the warehouse. The T-5s release an onslaught, and one bullet grazes my cheek and another strikes the back of my vest. I fall to the floor with the impact, scamper back to my feet in agony, and scurry across the floor. I duck behind a metal support beam and wait as the two remaining T-5s look at each other and calculate their next move and once they receive their orders from the Factory, they nod in agreement. One of them heads out the front door while the second marches toward the support beam. The second T-5 charges around, expecting to find me, but I'm not there. It searches for me and discovers I've come up behind it. The T-5 turns as I charge with the chain. I kick its gun from its hand and ram into the T-5. It's like hitting a truck, but I manage to knock it back. I twirl the metal chain over my head, swing, and wrap it a couple of times around the second T-5 and the beam. I take the long screwdriver, rush around to the back of the beam, push it through the links, and trap the T-5, but it won't hold for long. I grab its gun and check the chamber and magazine. They're empty. I toss the weapon, remove my backpack, and examine the lead pipe and the other screwdriver, then rush back to the boxing machine in the front, and lay the bag and lead pipe beside it. I grip the screwdriver and wait for an opportunity. I rub my sore shoulder where I ram into the T-5 and ignore the throbbing welt on my back.

The other T-5 enters from the side door and notices its brethren trying to squirm free from the chain. The other T-5 scans the warehouse, finding me with ease somehow and moves toward my position. I climb on the conveyer belt, run across it, and leap for the T-5. It raises its gun and fires three times. Two bullets hit me in the vest, and the third nicks the top of my head. I wince as I land on top of the T-5 and quickly stab the screwdriver through its forehead, and the T-5 stumbles back, swinging its arms wildly. I release the screwdriver, awkwardly jump off, and land flat out on my stomach on the concrete floor. The T-5 collapses, its body contorts in the last moments of mechanized life, and it ceases functioning. I roll to my side and put a hand on my chest where the two bullets struck my vest. They hurt worse than the one that hit my back and through the agony, I sit up, crawl to its gun, reach for the weapon, and hear someone step through the front entrance and move toward me. I sensed only six Un-Men. How did I miss one?

I whirl with the Un-Man's gun, train the weapon on the figure, and press my finger against the trigger. My vision blurs as blood trickles in my eyes from the small wound on top of my head, and it forces me to pause and make sure of my aim. A white-knuckle second passes before I realize the figure's not an Un-Man. I wipe my eyes with the back of my hand to make sure I'm not seeing things. It is Kimberly, and I almost killed her!

I lower the gun and stretch out my ability, searching for bio-mechas. There are no other Un-Men besides the one I chained up, so for now, we're safe. I exhale, releasing some of the tension in my shoulders. What was Kimberly thinking to step into the middle of a battle? I know she didn't come to help, so did she come to kill me?
Chapter Twenty-four

The Music Box

Minutes earlier...

Kimberly's view...

I pull my car into the overgrown back parking lot of Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse. Hades... I can't believe I'm doing this. I could already be in possession of the music box. I step from my vehicle, noticing two vans parked at the front curb. They're probably a good sign that the Pandora Project's here. I might yet get the music box. I rush to the front, hoping I'm not too late. If they managed to kill that woman, maybe the music box's still on her corpse. I enter through a door and spot her running across a conveyer belt and lunging for an Un-Man. The Un-Man shoots three times before that woman ends its existence and falls herself to the floor. She's very still at first, and I'm not sure if that woman's dead or not until I hear her moan. I watch her sit up, crawl to the Un-Man, and retrieve its gun. I move toward her, disappointed I'll have to finish the job myself. She's still on the ground when I approach her, and that woman reacts to my presence and turns her gun on me before I have a chance to react. I freeze as that woman stares at me as blood trickles down her brow. She wipes the plasma from her eyes and stands as her grim-gaze flames with glimmering sapphire. I take a step back from her. It's like I'm standing before the Mistress of the Underworld who has come to claim my soul.

Katharine's view...

I stare at Kimberly for a long time. I've seen that look before and know Kimberly's afraid of me. Is the light that my eyes produce that scary? Or is she seeing something else in me? Something I can't or I refuse to see in me?

I also know that she doesn't want to help me, so why can't she leave me alone? Is she trying to taunt me or only prolong my torment? I ask with a heavy heart, "Have you come to kill me?"

Kimberly's view...

I can't get past how her eyes glow and don't answer her at first. What kind of monstrosity is she? I regain my composure and finally answer, "No, I haven't come to kill you. I decided it would be too much of a hassle." I glance around the warehouse. "I wouldn't even be here if you didn't have something I want."

Katharine's view...

I stare at her a second longer, wondering what I could possibly have that she wants, and then I lower the gun and rub the vest where the bullets struck me. Kimberly is here to taunt me. Doesn't she have anything better to do?

I question, "What do you want?"

Kimberly's view...

"I want..." I catch a glimpse of a shadow moving toward us, and I step back, put some distance between myself and that woman, and remove my PPK from my purse.

Katharine's view...

I notice Kimberly's attention diverts slightly, so I turn and see that the last T-5 managed to release itself. Crap! I let myself get distracted, and I never sensed it moved.

"Target acquired," the T-5 states as it hones in on me. "Moving forward with capture."

The T-5's unarmed and tries to grab for me.

I run from its grasp as I lift the gun and pull the trigger and to my dismay, this gun's also empty. I turn to Kimberly and shout, "Shoot it!"

Kimberly peers at me as if what I'm telling her just doesn't make any sense. She turns to the T-5, and it observes her hesitation.

It scans her face and states, "Kimberly Griffin, daughter of the Chairman. Identity confirmed. Stay out of this Ms. Griffin and you will not be hurt."

Kimberly nods, lifts her gun so that she's aiming at neither of us, and takes a few more steps back.

"What are you doing?" I shout. "Shoot it!"

"Please don't tell me I have to explain it again," Kimberly says. "You're on your own."

Her words sear fear within me even more than the fear I experience when I face the Rogue. Anger and confusion also pour over me as I feel this pang in my heart. Kimberly could easily save me, but she's just going to stand there and watch the Un-Man kill me. The pain... it causes me to know she's abandoning me... it's... it's like she betraying me somehow. I shouldn't feel this way. We're strangers... right?

I move past my shock and dismay, and I throw the empty gun at the T-5. It smacks the weapon away as I bolt for the lead pipe I had laid by one of the boxing machines. I duck under the conveyer belt, grab the pipe, and continue under the machine to the safety of the other side and before the T-5 locks on to me with its targeting program, I run around the machine and whack it in the head. It stumbles back as I continue my assault. Kimberly didn't help me! She didn't want to help me!

I raise the weapon over my head and hammer its metal skull over and over, and I continue striking the T-5 even when it ceases moving. I turn to Kimberly and glare at her with my light-splintering eyes. I'm filled with fury and hurt, and a surge of purple flares within the blue Ult L-E.

Kimberly raises her gun and prepares to defend herself in case I come at her. I realize what I must look like, and my rage subsides as I see the look of fear in her eyes. The surge of purple fades, leaving the blue. I breathe deeply, quieting all that is within me. Fear, confusion, rage, shock... they all slowly leave me. I drop the pipe as my heart finally quiets, and the clang of metal resonates across the warehouse.

Kimberly's view...

How long have I been standing here gawking at that woman? I don't know, but I was so sure she'd come at me when she glared at me with those seething purple eyes. When she doesn't attack, I point my gun up and no longer aim at her. I focus on the smashed head of the T-5 and smart off to her by saying, "I see you have issues you're dealing with. Ever thought of seeing a shrink?"

Katharine's view...

Deeply upset with Kimberly over her indifference, I walk over to her, point at the Un-Man, and ask, "Why didn't you shoot it?"

I want to understand why she didn't help me. She should have helped me, so I point to myself and yell, "It was going to kill me."

Kimberly puts a hand on her hip and says, "That's my problem how? Idiot... Why do you insist I care?"

"You keep showing up! If you don't want to help me and you're not going to kill me, why do you keep showing up?" I feel my eyes return to normal as I tell her, "I don't understand."

"Like I said, that's my problem how?"

"Don't tell me then!" I shout, stomp over to the T-5 with the screwdriver in its forehead, and pull out the tool. Electrical snaps fire from its head as I wipe the black ooze covering the screwdriver on its suit. I snap at her like some child, "Keep showing up like a stalker and see if I care!"

"Stalker..? I'm not stalking you," Kimberly insists and then questions, "Why would I be stalking you?"

"How should I know? You're the stalker, not me," I tell her, glance at her, and then divert my gaze when she looks at me. I'm afraid she'll read my mind somehow. I don't want her to know, but I'm so glad she showed up. I feel safe when she's around, and I'm not sure why. Kimberly mostly points a gun at me anytime we're together.

I move to the table by the machine closest to the front door, remove my vest, and pull down the v-neck of my dingy t-shirt. I'm already bruised. I set the screwdriver on the table and examine two welts about an inch below my right collarbone. I also rub near my spine where the first bullet struck.

Kimberly says nothing as she watches me. I have no idea why she's here. I wish it was to help me. I wish it was to tell me that she does know me, and she's going to tell me about my past. She continues to watch me with her sour gaze, and I've had enough, so I demand, "Tell me why you're here."

Kimberly answers me, "I want to make it clear that I'm not a stalker."

"Fine, you're not a stalker," I reply and then mutter, "Freaking stalker..." I quickly glare at her, and after a few moments, I demand, "Tell me what you want." I walk over, wasting no time. I know more Un-Men can show up at any time, so I grab my backpack and return to the table. I unzip it and place the screwdriver in it. "Tell me and then leave me alone."

I say this, but I really don't want her to go. I want her to help me. I feel like she should help me.

"It's a deal," Kimberly tells me as she levels her gun on me. "I want the music box. Give it to me."

"No!" I utter as I pull the backpack off the table and step away from her. I shake my head as I tell her, "No! It's mine."

I feel betrayed by her request. I feel as though she has broken some sort of bond we've had for years by demanding such a thing of me.

"I hate repeating myself," she says. "Give me the music box or I'll kill you."

I shake my head again, moving backward toward the front door as my flight or fight instinct kicks in. She should be helping me, not doing this, so I yell, "No!"

"I'm not going to argue with you. Give it to me."

"No," I say and then insist, "It's mine." I plead with her as if she'll understand, "It's all I have left."

"Idiot..." Kimberly mutters, shrugs, shoots me, and hits me in the left shoulder. Smoke rolls from the barrel and with an emotionless expression, she says, "I did warn you."

It happened so fast... I made no move to protect myself... I glance down at the bullet hole, stunned by the assault, drop the backpack, stumble back, fall against the wall, and slide to the floor. I hold my bleeding wound as Kimberly approaches me and kneels to one knee right beside me. She coldly places the barrel of the gun on my right shoulder.

"Don't make me put another hole in you," Kimberly says and demands, "Tell me where it is."

This can't be happening. She... Kimberly couldn't have shot me, and she can't be going to steal the only thing that quiets the effects of the Ultra-Epi. Near tears, my lips quiver for the pain and fear of losing the only thing that has kept me going the past year. The pain in my shoulder is nowhere near the torment I feel over her betrayal. I should have expected this. I should've had my guard up, but I trusted her and felt safe around her.

"I won't," I tell her and then grunt, "It's... mine."

Kimberly tilts her head as if she doesn't understand me, then she backhands me across the face and states with an iciness in her voice, "I really hate this kind of work; it can get quite messy."

I sit there as if the most shocking thing just happened to me. I stare at her as I can't believe she slapped me. I put my other hand on my burning cheek and don't even have a thought to fight back.

Kimberly's blank face shows neither pleasure nor remorse as she says, "I'll only ask you once more, and then I'll search your dead body."

A sense of despair and loneliness strikes me as hard as she did, and I contemplate letting her end my existence, but the voice deep inside says no. Live. I move my blood covered hand to my thigh pocket, remove the music box, and stare at it.

"Give it here," Kimberly's says as she holds out her hand.

I say to her, "Promise me you'll give it back."

"What did you just say?"

"Promise me you'll give it back, and I'll loan it to you."

"Are you a child? Do you really think I'll..?" Kimberly starts, and then she says, "Fine, I promise." She snatches the box away from me and then says, "There, that wasn't so hard, now was it?"

She stands, turns, and heads for the front. Kimberly's leaving me... she's leaving me alone.

I start to get light headed but manage to push myself up the wall to stand and yell after her, "You promised. Don't forget to return it. It's just a loan." I press my hand against my wound. "The music box is all I have." I mumble, "I don't think I can go on without it."

Kimberly pauses at the front door and questions me with a hint of irritation, "What are you whining about?" Her cool and calm demeanor changes as she asks, "How many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what happens to you!"

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I panic and peer out the dust covered window as three vans pull up beside the other two. I turn to her and beg, "Please help me. Take me away from here. I'll die if I stay here."

"Help you?" Kimberly laughs and says, "Yeah right."

"Don't be cruel," I plead, "At least leave me some ammo."

"I'm not going to stand here and listen to this," Kimberly says as she starts out the door.

"Kimmie, please..."

She pauses as if I hit her in the head with a softball, then turns, and comes back in.

"What did you say? You little..." Kimberly starts as she marches towards me and aims her gun at me. "No one calls me that! No one calls me that anymore! Now die why don't you?"

I say nothing as I slide down the wall, land in a defeated heap, and stare at the floor. If I could only cry, at least then I would be doing something.

"You sicken me," Kimberly says with a snarl. "You..."

I look up when she speaks and see a shade of deviousness mark her face.

She questions me, "You want ammo?" Kimberly ejects her magazine and removes one round. "Here then." She pulls a thin permanent marker from her knapsack and writes on the shell casing. She puts the marker back in her knapsack, walks over, and sets the 9 mm round on the floor a short distance from me with the tip pointing up. "If things get unbearable..." Kimberly makes a gun with her left hand and fires it at her own head. "Do us all a favor."

She takes one more look at me, shakes her head, and leaves.

I stare at the bullet as the world crashes in on me. I read the words written on the shell, "Pale Horse". I lean my head back and close my eyes as my shoulder wound burns. I think about the note and then the man I loved and then lost.

Preacher, where are your encouraging words of light and hope now that the darkness is about to consume me? How am I going to survive this?

* * *

The Sanctum...

Deep underground, alarms blared, sending the Chamber into chaos as analysts scrambled, examining new data.

"What is going on?" Mr. Morta demanded.

"Pandora's vitals are dropping," frantic over the information, a supervisor relayed. "Our sensors are detecting major trauma and blood loss."

"What about Argus?" Mr. Decuma asked. "What does he have to report?"

"Two waves of Un-Men have attacked Pandora." Ms. Nona studied the data on her laptop. "It received the usual minor wounds. Argus also reports that a woman known as Ms. Griffin shot Pandora in the shoulder and took the music box."

Mr. Morta looked at each of the other members of the Council. "We never did figure out who gave Pandora the note, the business card, or the music box."

"Now it has none of them." Ms. Nona turned to the smaller of the two men. "Should we retrieve Pandora?"

"No, not yet," Mr. Decuma answered. "It will be a true test. Pandora has relied too much on the music box for emotional support. I have had my suspicions that an outside force has been interfering and now that that interference is gone, let us see what Pandora can do."
Chapter Twenty-five

A Message From The Past

Kimberly's view...

The sixth-hour tolls on the street clock as I rush out of Etna Toys, and then I hurry around to the back parking lot, not wanting to tangle with the Un-Men. I carry my gun in one hand and the music box in the other. An Un-Man leans against the passenger side of my car, so I slow to a walk, wary of it as I tuck the music box in the zipper pocket of my jacket.

I notice it's not armed except for a large knife in a sheath on its belt. I glance around the area to see if I'm surrounded, but I don't see anyone else.

"What do you want?" I ask. "You're one of the Factory's robots."

"Was," it tells me. "I am the one known as the Rogue."

"What do you want?" I repeat my question.

The Rogue tells me as I approach it, "Ms. Griffin, I do not understand."

I ask, suspicious of why it's here, "Don't understand what?"

"Pandora. If anyone else did what you did to her, they would be dead right now but not you. Actually, I have lost count of how many assassins she has decommissioned." It picks dirt out of its nails, and that's when I realize this is no normal robot. The Rogue says, "And before you boast your skills are why you are standing here, you should know... She trusted you," it says, not so much accusing me, but it sounds astonished by the fact. "I mean she really trusted you, and only one other did she place such hope and well, that minister is dead, but that is another story."

I search the area again to see if other Un-Men are around but none are. The Rogue's different. It's more human than the others in its manner and in its smile. It really creeps me out. The Rogue looks like it's studying me, and I wonder if it's somehow recording everything about me.

"I do not know why, but Pandora drops her guard when you are around. How else could you betray her?"

I keep a tight grip on my gun as I reply, "You're insinuating she trusted me."

"Ah, I see you are skeptical, but Pandora did... does trust you. The first case in point, she removed her Ravlek Vest. Why would she do that if threatened by you?"

I shrug and ready myself to shoot it at the slightest hint of an attack.

"I cannot figure it out either," the Rogue states. "What is it about you? I do not think Pandora realizes she is doing it. Maybe deep down in her subconscious she believes she knows you. Maybe she believes you two have met in the past or maybe you did not point a gun at her when you first met. I believe that quality alone might endear someone to her, but I could be wrong. I do not know. I was not there." It adds, "Or was I?"

"I don't understand something." I'm impatient to leave, so I ask, "Why are you telling me all this?"

"Oh, that is right." The Rogue mimics my voice and says, "How many times do I have to tell you? I don't care what happens to you!"

I'm amazed that I hear my own voice, and I start to question, "How did you–"

"Oh, please. I am a machine. I can reproduce any sound," the Rogue says, and then it asks, "Would you like me to repeat Pandora's plea for you to save her? It was so sweet and innocent. Even I heard the fear in it. I heard the fear that you would leave her to her fate and that she would die alone."

"I don't have time for this so if you don't mind, I'm leaving." I start to walk around to the driver's side, keeping my distance from the Rogue.

It ignores my wishes and mimics that woman by saying, "Please help me. Take me away from here. I'll die if I–"

"Stop it!" I snap. "I said I didn't–"

"Want to hear it. I know, but I am supposed to be heartless." The Rogue eyes me accusingly. "Humans are the ones who have to work at it."

"Why are you here?" I snarl, agitated by the accusations. "What do you want?"

The Rogue turns to the warehouse and moves its hand and caresses the handle of its large knife. "I want to kill Pandora, but it seems the T-3s will beat me to her." The Rogue turns to me and says, "You know they have been acting strange lately but then, what does a rogue know?" It moves from my car and walks a couple of paces away from me. "Well, be seeing you. I am too depressed to watch the outcome of the battle. Pandora does not have a chance."

The Rogue takes off running and soon disappears from sight.

I slide into the seat of my car, take one more look at Etna Toys, start up the engine, and pull away. Finally, I'm rid of this Pandora mess. I drive for twenty minutes, getting some distance between myself and the warehouse. I pull over, anxious to look at the music box, and then I remove it from my pocket, hold it in my palm, and examine it. Some of that woman's dried blood covers the top.

Mom, why did you want me to get this? Father said it's a data storage unit. I turn it over and over, studying it, trying to figure out how it works and what kind of information is on it.

I think how badly I missed my mom and how I'll make whoever took her away from me pay dearly. Maybe it will tell me who murdered her, so I open the lid, and Unfinished Melody plays. I close it and turn it over, examining every side again. Nothing... There's nothing... I stare at the music box. Now, what am I suppose to do? How am I to find your murderer? I don't even know where to start.

I whisper, "Mom, I..."

A hum emanates from the music box as two tiny squares on each end of it glow blue, and the light radiates through the metal surface. I examine each square then place my thumb and index finger over them. The music box vibrates, and a 3-D image of my mom's head and shoulders materializes above the lid.

The hologram speaks, "Voice identity confirmed as Kimberly Griffin. Data storage unit activated." The hologram blinks a couple of times, and she glances around as if awakening from a deep sleep. The hologram scans me and states, "Kimmie, if you are viewing this, I am probably dead. There are so many things I want to tell you but now isn't the time. I hope... no, I pray, not too much time has passed. There is something you must do. You are so young, eighteen."

"You're two decades too late," I say as I run my hand through the image. "I'm sorry it took me so long to come across the photo."

"Two decades have passed? It does change things," the hologram speaks and then pauses, processing the information. "It may be too late then."

I'm surprised the hologram spoke to me, so I lift the music box and ask, "You can hear me?"

"Yes, I am programmed to interact."

A childlike joy bounces through me as I say, "I have so many questions, but you said too late. Too late for what?"

"First, promise me you will do this thing. Do this thing for your mother." The hologram adds as an afterthought, "It will be dangerous."

I chuckle, thinking of my years as a Life Closer and glance at the gun I laid on the passenger seat. "I think I can handle dangerous."

"Then all I need to hear is that you promise and I will tell you."

I eagerly say, "I promise."

"Theresa hates giving this task to you, but there is no one else she can trust." The hologram looks worried as she speaks, "Theresa had made so many enemies in and out of the corporation." The hologram rakes her bangs out of her own eyes as she continues, "As Project Manager of Research and Development, Theresa was privy to many projects in other departments. You may not remember, but one unspeakable one caught her attention. It involved children, and she tried to put a stop to it. Now you must take up where she failed." The hologram's image flickers as she speaks, "I don't know how you will find her, but there is this girl..." The hologram pauses and then says, "Well, she would be a woman now. Her name is Katharine."

A bad feeling comes over me as I gasp and murmur, "Hades... No... It can't be."

The hologram continues, "You must save her from them. The only other thing I can tell you is the project name she is under."

I put my hand to my temple in disbelief and mutter, "Don't tell me. It's Pandora."

The hologram replies, "Yes, but how did you know?"

"Let's say I've encountered her."

A beeping alarm goes off, and the hologram says, "Someone is monitoring this transmission." She turns her head as if looking outside. "I must terminate communication."

"Wait!" I exclaim. "I have so many questions. Who killed my mom?"

"There are many possible suspects but that isn't important right now. You must save Katharine. Save her. She's the key." The hologram stares right at me as she speaks, "You will not be able to activate this unit until it is safe. Find her."

Her image disappears, and I'm left alone with my questions.

"Key to what? Wait!" I shout as I shake the music box. "Tell me!"

I slam my fist on the steering wheel. Why couldn't she have told me? I lean back in my seat, staring at the ceiling. I can't believe this! For Ares' sake! What's with my luck?

I envision myself back at Etna, trying to explain my return to that woman.

"Hey Katharine, umm, sorry I shot you in the shoulder." I force a smile and put on a chuckle as I say, "Funny thing... I... Ah... Have come back to save you."

The awkward scene fades in my mind as I mutter, "Who's the idiot now?"

I throw my hands up. What am I going to say to her? I rub my temple as I stare at the music box, open it, and Unfinished Melody plays. I can't believe it, that woman was right! I am turning out to be a stalker.

I take a deep breath. I guess I'll have to swallow my pride and go get that woman. That's if she isn't dead. Hades! What if she's dead? What will I do?

I quickly place the music box in my glove compartment and start the car. What kind of messed up world have I stumbled into? I'm a Closer for Ares' sake! I make a U-turn and floor the pedal, heading back to Etna Toys. When did saving people enter my job description?
Chapter Twenty-six

A New Development

6:22 P.M...

Minutes before Kim arrived in the car to take the music box away from Kat, Peters and Maxwell went over data from the latest Un-Men trial. Peters stepped from the van to the sidewalk and stretched. The two S.C.Ms. looked over as he exited, and they nodded to him and went about their guard duty. Peters raked his fingers through his unkempt black hair, glanced up at the barriercumulus ever entombing the mega-city, and remembered when he was a kid over thirty years ago. If he closed his eyes he could still see it, the fiery orange ball shining on Noir. No one fathomed back then that one day the sun that gave the planet life would be blotted from the sky.

Peters removed his glasses, rubbed his tired eyes, and said, "I've been thinking."

Inside the van, Maxwell turned from the table and inquired, "What's that?"

"What if you were right? What if the T-3s and the Rogue each have a ghost in the machine?" Peters rubbed his palms together as the air grew chilly then put his hands in his lab coat pockets. "What if they are evolving and becoming self-aware?"

Maxwell chuckled as he asked, "Are you kidding?" He joined Peters on the sidewalk and said, "You've been reading those old Science Fiction books again. You need to invest your money in better things. The Corporate Senate insist that novels will rot your brain. Why do you think they banned them in the first place?"

Peters said, "Please, don't even get me started on the book ban. What's wrong with stories?" The rumble of engines distracted him, so he turned, glanced behind them, and asked, "Who's this?"

Three vans drove down the street and stopped a short distance behind the two already parked at the curb.

"What are they doing here?" Peters wondered aloud as he moved to the end of their van. "We never requested a third batch of Un-Men." He waved over the two S.C.Ms. and ordered them, "Go talk to the driver and see why they're here."

The S.C.Ms. headed for the first vehicle.

"I thought we were the only team working today," Maxwell commented as he peered at the driver's side of the first van and only saw his own reflection in the tinted glass.

"What did you say?" Peters asked as he reviewed his notes.

"I said I thought we were the only team working today."

"We are," Peters answered as he glanced at the S.C.Ms.

"I know," Maxwell spoke as he started to go back into the van. "It was a statement, not a question."

The first S.C.M. adjusted his assault rifle's strap that rested on his shoulder, glanced at the second S.C.M. to make sure the other soldier had his back, and tapped the driver's window. The first S.C.M. motioned with his finger as he said, "Roll down your window."

There was no response.

"Did you hear me?" the first S.C.M. questioned. "I said..."

The electric window hummed as it lowered, and a man with a pale face turned his head and stared at the soldier. The driver's light blue eyes looked unreal and made him recoil a bit.

The driver greeted, "Hey there gov."

"You aren't supposed to be here." The first S.C.M. pointed toward the techs and relayed, "A team is already in place."

The driver tilted his head and questioned, "Are you sure? I'm pretty... pretty... sure we are to be here, poppet."

"Poppet?" the first S.C.M. repeated as he removed his assault rifle. "You need to check your orders. You shouldn't be here. You've made a mistake."

The second S.C.M. also removed his weapon, sensing the uneasiness in the other soldier.

"It is you who has made a mistake," the driver said. "We are supposed to be here, and it is plain to see that you have–" The driver lifted a handgun and fired three shots at the soldiers, killing the first S.C.M. "–misunderstood the reason for our arrival."

The second S.C.M. stumbled back after a bullet nicked him in the neck. He saw that the other soldier had been killed, raised his FAMAS, and opened fire on the driver, shouting, "He's an Un-Man!"

Maxwell and Peters dove to the ground, hearing the gunfire.

"Who are they shooting at?" Maxwell shouted, covering his head with his hands.

"I don't know!"

Peters was beside him and was afraid to look up.

The T-3 got out of the vehicle, walked to the second S.C.M., shot him in the stomach, and grabbed the man by the throat and with one quick turn, it broke the S.C.M.'s neck and dropped his limp body to the road.

Maxwell heard no more gunfire, so he scrambled along the sidewalk to the back of the van and looked around the vehicle's tire, and he saw the T-3.

"I don't believe it," Maxwell whispered back to his partner. "The Un-Man is wearing contacts to hide its identity." He started back and insisted, "We've got to get out of here." He looked at Peters who was frozen in fear. "Did you hear me? Get in the van!" Maxwell shouted.

He ran to the passenger's side, got in, tossed himself to the driver's seat, and started up the vehicle. He threw the gear shift to D just as Peters jumped in the back through the sliding door. Maxwell floored the pedal, and the vehicle peeled off.

Eleven more T-3s unloaded from the vans and in unison, the twelve marched past the sidewalk in three lines and halted. They stared at Etna Toys as they stated, "Preparing to engage the main target."

Peters closed the side door, questioning, "What just happened?" He moved over and held onto the bolted table as computers and equipment moved across it. "A T-3 killed two of our soldiers."

Maxwell wiped sweat from his head as he asked, "Are they pursuing?"

"No." Peters caught one last glimpse of the area before their van turned a corner. "They're staring at the warehouse. I think they're going after Pandora."

"Why would they on their own?" After making the turn, Maxwell floored the pedal a second time, and the van sped off. "And how did they get out of the Factory?" He dreaded the answer as he ordered, "Peters, get up here! Radio in and see what you can find out."

Peters got in the passenger's seat, grabbed the mic, and pressed the side button. "Factory, this is Tech One-eleven, we have a situation. Please respond." He released the button, and static returned his request, so Peters repeated the frantic call, "Factory, this is Tech One-eleven, please respond." He turned to Maxwell and proclaimed, "I don't like this one bit."

"Keep calling." Maxwell said hopeful, "Someone will pick up."

"Factory, this is Tech One-eleven. Please respond."

Static...

"Factory, this is Tech One-eleven. Please respond..."

Hellenistic Sector, Industrial Vicinage...

At Etna Toys...

Two blocks away from the four remaining vans and in the safety of an alley, Argus monitored the new development with the T-3s through his binoculars. He witnessed them killing the S.C.Ms. and the techs fleeing the scene, and then he reported in, "Patch me immediately to the Council."

The Chamber...

A female supervisor transferred the call to an intercom in the center of the table and once she finished, she stated, "Go ahead. You're patched in."

"Council, Argus here. A dozen T-3s arrived and took out two Factory soldiers. They're now moving on the warehouse."

Mr. Morta said, "It would seem the Factory has lost control of their Un-Men. I wonder..."

Ms. Nona turned to him and inquired, "Wonder about what?"

"What is the T-3s' true purpose?" Mr. Morta questioned. "I have a feeling there is more to their arrival than merely taking out Pandora. Perhaps they have another agenda."

Mr. Decuma asked, "Should we act?"

"Not yet, but make the preparations and for now, we will do what we do best. We will watch." Mr. Morta turned to the supervisor and started, "Inform Argus–"

Gunfire came over the intercom and interrupted him.

"Two T-3s have moved on my position!" Argus shouted. "Returning fire!" More gun blast erupted along with a pain-filled grunt from him and he stated, "I've been hit in the leg. Retreating! I'll..."

White noise replaced his voice.

"Communication has been severed," the supervisor reported. "I'll attempt to reestablish." After a few seconds, she turned to them with a look of worry and informed them, "My attempt failed."

Mr. Morta stood, turned his back on the other two members, contemplated the situation, and faced them. "I am afraid everything has changed. The T-3s do have another agenda, and we need to act. Get me the commander of our S.C.Ms."

Inside Etna Toys...

Katharine's view...

I lean against the cold concrete wall, staring at the 9 mm round Kimberly placed on the floor, and I press against the bullet wound in my shoulder as blood trickles down my left side. A fluorescent light flickers overhead as my hot breath steams in the chilly air. Fifteen minutes have gone by since the sixth hour tolled and since Kimberly left with the music box. I'm empty and distraught without the calming Unfinished Melody, and I shiver, growing ever cold. I'm not sure if I'm cold because of the weather or from the blood loss.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

Everything within me screams for me to flee, so I endure the pain, push myself up the wall, and smear blood across its gray blocks. I slowly start for the side door when two T-3s enter and block my escape, so I turn for the front door, but it's too late. Within seconds, a dozen T-3s march in and surround me like a horde of metal Golems as I stand there exhausted and weak, waiting for their next move. All of them stare at me as if they're pleased that they've recaptured me, but they make no attempt to seize me. I glance at the Ravlek Vest lying on the table some distance from me. I'm defenseless without it.

The dozen T-3s slowly raise their guns and aim at me. Their fiery crimson dot-light blinks as they communicate with each other and with those who aren't present. Something's different about all of them. The T-3s can think and act as one without the Factory.

The Team Leader, the one who has blue contacts, states, "Pandora acquired."

I tense... There's no escape for me.

"Secondary objective completed," the Team Leader says and orders, "Disable Pandora."

Two T-3s step forward, and one lifts its hand and backhands me, knocking me across the room. I land on a tarp that's covering empty boxes near the front door. Dust flies up and fills my lungs along with the smell of cardboard. I'm nearly knocked out, but I cling to consciousness. The two T-3s separate and come at me from different directions, expecting a fight from me. One of them inadvertently kicks the round that's lying on the floor, and the bullet bounces and rolls to me. I lie there stunned and dazed but manage the strength to apply pressure to my wound. The first T-3 to arrive by my side pauses and notices the blood, so it grabs my hand, lifts it, and sees the bullet hole. It places its finger in my wound, and I cry out.

The T-3 examines the blood on its nail, turns to the Team Leader, and speaks, "Pandora has been disabled. Should I proceed with her termination?"

"No," the Team Leader answers. "Hold. We will take her back to the Factory. Perhaps we will learn some valuable information from her." It walks to the elevator and orders, "The rest of you proceed with the first objective." It points and commands, "Open those doors."

Three of the twelve move forward and stop when they hear the elevator activate on its own and within a minute, the elevator comes to a halt and opens. Five pairs of yellow eyes glow within the dark cab, and the unknown creatures growl before leaping on a T-3. The mechanical creatures are K-99s. They're an early model of bio-mecha that resembles Irish Wolfhounds down to the steel-gray wavy fur. The K-99s bite and claw at the Un-Man till one of them rips off its head. During the attack, the elevator closes and returns empty.

"Take them out!" the Team Leader orders, aiming its weapon.

The T-3s open fire, destroying two of the K-99s. The remaining three K-99s run six feet from the elevator, turn, and form a line as they face their adversary. A compartment on their backs opens, and a small machine gun raises into position. The K-99s attack with their weapons and fill the large room with the roar of gun blasts. The T-3s return fire, and the K-99s barrage takes down three of the T-3s before they're destroyed. The warehouse falls silent as smoke from gunpowder rises in the air like a grayish-white cloud.

"Open those doors," the Team Leader commands.

Four of the remaining eight T-3s move forward as a shrilling whistle emanates from a K-99, and its body glows.

The Team Leader immediately hears the sound and recognizes the noise and commands, "Fall back!"

The T-3s flee as the K-99 explodes, knocking all of them to the floor. The Team Leader stands and looks over the others and sees the four whom it sent to open the doors are damaged. Three of them are completely destroyed and lay in pieces as the fourth, whose legs had been blown off, pulls itself across the floor. One Un-Man who's part of the group with the Team Leader remains undamaged.

The Team Leader moves to the area I'm in, motions to the T-3s guarding me, and orders, "You two, join our other brethren and then the three of you open the elevator."

"Understood," they reply and move off, leaving the Team Leader to guard me.

Once they join their brethren, the three T-3s march to the elevator and pass their crawling comrade. Two of the T-3s tuck their guns and grab the doors, prying them open while the third covers them with its weapon in case there are more surprises within. They force the elevator open and find an empty lit cab. The two T-3s remove their weapons and enter the cab as the third follows. The third one moves to press the basement button when a white sticky web shoots from the ceiling, entangling it in a cocoon like a helpless fly. The other two T-3s raise their guns, firing at the ceiling as six spider bio-mechas, model Arachnoid, crawl in through the escape hatch. They're two-foot in diameter and all metal. The lights are hit, and the cab falls dark. The Arachnoids study the Un-Men with their eight, green, beady eyes before jumping down and attacking the remaining two T-3s. The elevator closes.

The Team Leader turns to me as it uplinks with others of its kind, and it states, "Lost containment of sight." It lifts its gun, aiming at me as its fake blue eyes show neither remorse or pleasure. "I can no longer secure Pandora. Extraction failed. I will terminate her."
Chapter Twenty-eight

The End For One

Moments earlier...

Katharine's view...

There are a few Un-men left, and I watch the battle between bio-mechas, not sure what's going on. The Un-Men usually come after me and have no other agenda but to kill me. These T-3s are different. They're after something that's here. For once, I'm not their primary target. I press against my shoulder, trying to stop the bleeding and wince for the pain.

I glance at the dog bio-mechas who had so bravely faced the Un-Men. I cough for the dust I stirred up and watch as the T-3s open the elevator for the second time. I witness the Arachnoids attack the T-3s and once the elevator closes again, the Team Leader turns to me and aims at me. I desperately search for a weapon and feel along the dusty concrete, but I only find the 9 mm round. I whimper, defeated as I stare down the barrel of the Team Leader's gun. I've faced death many times, but it hasn't been so grim. There's always some hope I'll survive but not this time. Knowing this is it, I look around the warehouse and consider my life. It seems my search will end where it all began. I clench the bullet and hold it to my chest, too weak to stop the Team Leader as I hear Pale Horse's rider galloping in the distance as he comes for me.

My minds so quiet I completely link with the Team Leader and know its mechanical thoughts. It has its orders. The Team Leader's to eliminate me and return to base. It will make sure I die quickly, and two shots to the head should be sufficient to do the task. I see through its eyes as it envisions itself pulling the trigger. It turns its head as muzzle flashes erupt twice and empty shells fall to the floor and bounce. I jerk as the shots echo across the building and smoke rolls from the gun. Liquid trickles from two wounds in the forehead and slowly converge at the nose.

The Team Leader's already staring at the front door as it speaks, "Pretty... poppet?"

It collapses to its knees and falls on its face as its artificial blood spills from the two wounds in its head. I lose my connection with it as it dies. I open my eyes and stare at the disabled T-3. I feel myself slowly fading and can't understand why it's dead and not me. Did it shoot at me and miss? I don't think I've been hit again, but I can't be sure, not the way I feel. Maybe none of this is real. Maybe I'm dead and this is only an illusion dreamt during my eternal slumber.

I hear someone clear their throat, so I look at the door and see a person there, aiming their gun at where the T-3 had been. Kimberly saved me... I'm weakening by the second, but I try to stay conscious and figure out what part she plays in this cruel test. I decide I don't care... I'm so glad she's here. I'm alive because she's here.

Kimberly's view...

I lower my gun and move to that woman, relieved I made it in time. Here I've been hoping one of these robots would off her and now... Now I'm not sure. I still wish she had been eliminated from my life, but then I wouldn't find out what she's the key to.

"Well, I'm back," I state as if I'm announcing my entrance to a party. I still can't believe I'm helping her. For Ares' sake... this is all so ridiculous.

"Well..?" I start as I scan the area for more robots and notice what looks like dogs in pieces and the one robot with no legs pulling itself toward us. I question, "Are you going to sit there or are we going to leave?"

"You came back?" that woman says in a weakening voice. "But I thought..." She tries to sit up and push herself forward, but she doesn't seem to have the strength, so she gives up and lies back down. "I thought... you didn't want to help me."

"Things change. Why are you complaining? For Ares' sake! Be glad I came back, and where's my thank you for saving your life?" I question and start to snap at her again, but then I notice her pale complexion. I set the safety on my gun, tuck it in my shoulder holster, kneel beside her, place my arm around her, and help her up. "Ahh..." I utter as I nearly vomit. "Have you ever heard of a bath?"

She grits her teeth as I haul her to her feet, and we make our way out. The car's outside in the front parking lot, and we make our way to it. I lean her against the car, open the passenger door, set her inside, and buckle her in. I step back and look at the interior of my car.

"Try not to bleed on the leather."

I shut the door, hurry to the other side, start up the engine, and drive off, kicking up leaves as I head for the nearest hospital. I drive for a few minutes, glancing ever so often in my rearview mirror. No one's following us. I drive for a few more minutes.

"Thank you."

I glance at that woman who's leaning against the door as she peers at me.

"I would be dead right now if you hadn't of came back for me."

"Don't thank me," I tell her as I turn my attention back to the road. "You still might die on me."

End Kimberly's view...

Back inside Etna Toys...

The elevator doors opened, and the Council exited as five S.C.Ms. armed with XM8 assault rifles followed them. The soldiers wore a dark green uniform with a shoulder patch of the Sphinx Corporation Emblem, and the Council's Crest of a silver spool of thread, a tape measure, and a pair of scissors hung above the shield. The S.C.Ms. spread out and secured the perimeter. Two of them approached the legless T-3 pulling itself across the floor, and the S.C.Ms. shot and disabled it.

Mr. Morta looked over the mess of bio-mecha parts and spoke, "It would seem the Sanctum has been compromised. The T-3s somehow discovered our base, but why attack us?" He turned to the lead S.C.M. and told him, "We are abandoning Etna Toys. Pull up the Sanctum. We will look for another base of operations."

"At once."

The S.C.M. entered the elevator, and the cab doors closed.

"Yes, why attack us?" Mr. Decuma questioned as he walked up beside Mr. Morta. "And why capture Argus? Are we sure the Factory is not behind this?"

"I doubt it," Ms. Nona answered. "The T-3s did kill two of the Factory's corporate military men."

"Unless that and the news that the T-3s went rogue were all a ruse," Mr. Morta stated. "Either way, some force is after us, and I would like to know why. Only a handful of people know of our existence."

"The more important question is, were they here to destroy us or were they after our research?" Ms. Nona asked.

Mr. Decuma added, "Yes, a very good question."

Mr. Morta knelt beside a K-99, petted its furry head, and whispered, "All of you did well. You protected the Sanctum."

Ms. Nona walked up beside him. "What about Pandora?" She paused, waiting for a reply and continued when he said nothing. "After more than a year, I think it is about time we deemed Pandora a failure."

"I agree," Mr. Decuma said. "We should terminate the project." He glanced at the Team Leader who was face down in a black pool. "Pandora would have died if Ms. Griffin had not interfered. I say we terminate our first attempt and begin on the second."

Mr. Morta glanced at the other Council members and stood. "Activate the second project. It will take time before it is operational, so for now, we will let Pandora live." He looked out the front windows and stated, "I am curious as to why Ms. Griffin shot then saved Pandora. Could the Chairman be interfering with our work?"

"I do not believe he is," Ms. Nona said.

Mr. Decuma added, "Unless he has an agenda we have no knowledge of. Perhaps we should place more Moles into the Third Branch Office."

Ms. Nona replied, "I think we should not be hasty."

"I agree," Mr. Morta stated.

"Perhaps both of you are correct," Mr. Decuma said. "But we do need to send in a new operative to monitor Pandora while Argus is MIA. I will set the paperwork in motion."

He started for the elevator, and Ms. Nona followed him.

Mr. Morta's view...

I stay back and monitor the cleanup of the K-99s. I stare off in thought, wondering if Pandora realized it. Did she know that the very people she searched for were right underneath her feet?

I can't help but think fondly of her. She has come so close to discovering us. I secretly admire her persistence. What will she do now? Will she trust Ms. Griffin after what she did to her? I consider Ms. Griffin's involvement in this. Could the Chairman have sent his daughter in for some reason? Does the Chairman want the Pandora Project for himself?

* * *

A half hour later...

The Rogue made its way to one of the Factory's vans parked at the curb in front of Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse. It opened the side door, keeping an eye on the few Council S.C.Ms. still within the warehouse. They hadn't spotted it. The Rogue looked inside the vehicle and found what it was looking for, so the Rogue entered the van, slid the door shut, and sat at the table before the computer. It logged on to the Factory's main system and pulled up a few files, scanning for information on Pandora. The Rogue searched for several minutes and finally found what it was looking for when the files started disappearing. Someone was deleting the Factory's system. It would have to act fast if it wanted to get any information, so the Rogue opened a file and read over it with robotic speed. The file mentioned an experiment called organic-mecha and referenced another file, and the Rogue quickly pulled it up. The file stated that organic-mechas proceeded bio-mechas.

"Why did Sphinx abandoned the project and does organic-mechas have anything to do with me or Pandora?" it questioned aloud.

The Rogue found another reference but before it could read the file, it was deleted. The Rogue slammed its fist on the table as the remaining files deleted and the link to the mainframe disconnected. There was no more that it could do, so the Rogue stood and slid open the door. Two S.C.Ms. stood outside, aiming their weapons at it.

"Hello," the Rogue said as it raised its hands in surrender and stepped from the van. "You really do not want to do this. I can tell by your shoulder patch that you work for the Council. Let me go and this will not get messy."

An S.C.M. touched his earpiece and spoke, "Inform the Council we have the Rogue."

"Have?" it questioned and stated, "Have is such a strong word."

In one quick motion, the Rogue removed its knife and cut across the one soldier's throat. Blood spurted as the second S.C.M. fired his assault rifle. It evaded the shots and tackled the man to the ground, stripping the soldier of his weapon, and the Rogue buried its knee in the man's chest, and the soldier could hardly breathe.

It said, "I want you to give the Council a message."

His face mangled in pain as he grabbed at the Rogue's arms, trying to force the Un-Man off of him.

"Tell the Council to leave me alone, and I will leave them alone. If not..." The Rogue grabbed his arm and twisted it hard. "Things will get broken."

The man screamed just as three more S.C.Ms. ran out of Etna Toys.

The Rogue stood and took off as they fired, and it disappeared down a street. It ran several blocks, came upon a major street, and hailed a taxi.

"Where to?" the male driver asked.

The Rogue entered the back, replying, "The nearest hospital. I am feeling a little under the weather."

The driver looked at the pale-faced passenger, wondered if whatever he had might be contagious, nodded, and drove down the road.

Quietly sitting in the back, the Rogue contemplated that it knew so little about Pandora. It did realize that it didn't need to know her to kill her. All it needed to know was where she went, and it had a pretty good idea.
Chapter Twenty-nine

Not Out Of Danger Yet

7:47 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Within the Corvette...

Katharine's view...

I am grateful that she saved me, but I can't get the memory of her shooting me to stop replaying in my mind. My wound still burns as much as confusion plagues me. Why did Kimberly injure me then save me? I'm in agony as I turn and lean my head against the passenger's side window. Buildings and street lights speed by in the blackness. I clench Pale Horse and press that hand against the seeping hole in my shoulder as I look down at my blistered left palm lying limp on my leg. The sharp ache in my shoulder redirects my focus, and I hardly notice the throbbing and burning of the scorched skin.

Kimberly steers the Corvette through Healing Way and turns at the entrance to Asclepius Hospital as she talks on a cell phone.

"Yes, Brian, it's me. Don't hang up! Now listen, I want you–" She pauses as he interrupts her, and then Kimberly snaps, "Don't tell me that! You owe me and I collect what's owed to me. Now..." She calms herself. "We need to do this covertly, so where do you want to meet?" Kimberly pauses, listening to him. "Okay, we'll be there in a minute."

She hangs up and drives to the west side where they're remodeling the hospital. A doctor in white scrub pants and a shirt skittishly waits with a wheelchair as we near one of the buildings. He looks around the empty parking lot and the surrounding area, and then he runs over to us, pushing the wheelchair as Kimberly pulls over. He opens the passenger door, and I notice his name badge. Dr. Brian Chiron has kind brown eyes and dark brown hair.

Kimberly's view...

Brian helps that woman into the wheelchair, sees red staining my cream colored leather seat, and questions, "What happened?"

"Later," I snap. "Get her inside and stop the bleeding. I'm going to park the car." I glance again at the passenger seat and yell, "Hades! I'll also need to clean up in here before I come in."

"Don't leave her with me," Brian demands. "And this will make us even."

"For Ares' sake, I won't and we're far from being even." I command, "Shut the door. I'll meet you inside."

Brian closes the door, and I pull off.

Sometime later...

Katharine's view...

Brian quickly wheels me into a room. Plastic sheets cover the bed and counters, and a single window reveals the dark parking lot outside. He removes one of the sheets, and then he grabs latex gloves and pulls them on. Brian helps me to sit on the examining bed, starts to remove my jacket, notices the burn on my palm, and that I'm gripping something in my right hand. He carefully removes my left sleeve, pulls the right one over my fisted hand, tosses the bloody jacket to the floor, and sets me back. He unpacks several sterile instruments, then takes surgical scissors, and cuts my blood-soaked t-shirt off and throws the t-shirt to the tile floor. He starts to cut my sports bra off when I grab his arm with my injured left hand.

"Leave it," I bark like a wounded dog and glare at him, remembering my fate at the hands of the techs and doctors when the Factory captured me. They did a lot of horrible things to me.

Brian tells me, "I'll only cut the one strap off, is that okay? I need to operate on your shoulder."

I'm growing fainter by the second, and I don't know if I can trust him. I consider that Kimberly's the one who brought me here so maybe I can trust him. I remove my hand from his gloved one and relax a little.

"Roll on your side," Brian requests, then cuts the one strap, removes it, and examines the back of my shoulder. "The bullet went all the way through. I only have to get in there and stop the bleeding." He has me lie on my back, and then he rushes into the hall to a medicine closet and unlocks it. Brian opens a drawer, pulls out a couple of needles, grabs some vials, and heads back. He set the items on the counter, unwraps one of the needles, and sticks it in a vial. Brian notices that I'm silently watching him with distrusting eyes, so he tells me, "This is an antibiotic and after I inject you, I'm also going to give you something to numb your shoulder while I operate on it." He gives me the injections and inquires, "Who did this to you?"

I say nothing only accusingly stare at Kimberly as she enters, and Brian notices the look I give her and continues his work.

Kimberly goes and stands by him. "I searched the floor, and no one's here." She peers over his shoulder and asks, "Will it take long?"

"Not too long," he answers. "Could you step back out of my light?"

She walks around the bed, stands by the wall, crosses her arms, and watches intently.

With surgeon precision and tender hands, Brian works on my shoulder for more than twenty minutes and then touches my arm to get my attention. "Can you roll on your side? We're halfway there."

I roll over and stare at Kimberly as the doctor works, and I can't help but wonder if this is some sort of trick. Kimberly could be working for the Council, and she's only after my music box but if that's true, she didn't have to save me. I close my eyes, not wanting to look at the glaring Phoenix. It doesn't matter to me if Kimberly helps me or not. I open my eyes as if I discovered the answer. Maybe I do care, and I feel hurt and betrayed by her because I want Kimberly to help me but instead, she left me to die. I don't know... I feel lost and want to cradle myself against the emotional and physical pain, and I look for the music box. I need it. A headache has already started.

Kimberly's view...

I notice that woman is gripping something in her hand. I never did check her for a weapon and she might be thinking of repaying me for what I did to her earlier, so I demand, "Give me what you have."

That woman glares back at me as she clinches her fist.

"Give it here," I demand as I put a hand to my purse that's dangling from my shoulder. "Remember I won't ask a third time."

She opens her hand, and I see that it's a 9 mm round. I'm about to ignore it when I remember its the bullet I left for that woman. I study it more closely and see my own handwriting. She must have picked it up, and she might be saving it to use on me later. I take the bullet, wipe most of the blood on a plastic sheet, and place the bullet in my pocket. I'll save Pale Horse and use it when I kill her, and it'll be a fitting end to our bizarre partnership.

Brian starts on a stitch when something seems to catch his attention. I move closer and see that he's looking at something shiny halfway embedded below that woman's skin. The bullet must have nicked the object, dislodging it enough to appear in the wound. He grabs an overhead lamp and pulls it close.

"Kim, hand me the small forceps."

I hand the tweezer size instrument to him and then ask, "What is it?"

He removes the small metal object and drops it in a stainless steel tray. "I don't know." Brian pushes it across the tray with the forceps and flips it over, examining the rectangular thing the size of a grain of rice. "It looks like a chip they place in pets to identify them if they're lost."

A realization sinks in, and I say, "It's more than that." I pick up the tray with the metal device and walk around to face that woman. "Is this how they've been tracking you? Does this thing tell them where to send the Un-Men?"

"What are Un-Men?" Brian questions.

"I'll explain later." I turn my attention back to that woman and ask, "Well, is it? Do you know you're some sort of experiment?" I demand, "What are you? What are you the key to? Tell me!"

"I'm the Pandora Project," she answers. "I'm hunted and tested."

"What does that mean? What's the Pandora Project?"

Katharine's view...

"Haven't you been listening? I already told you I can't remember my past, so you know as much as I do." I want to wrap myself into a fetal position and shield myself from the frustrating questions that have haunted me the past year.

"Maybe you should–" Brian starts to tell Kimberly.

"Don't butt in!" she shouts at him, and then she starts to leave the room with the metal device and yells at me, "If you don't want to tell me, fine!"

"Where are you going?" Brian asks.

Kimberly pauses outside the door and answers, "I'm going to get rid of this thing."

"Wouldn't it be better to keep it?"

"No, I think it's caused enough problems."

Kimberly's view...

I go to a restroom, flush the tracking beacon, and return.

He finishes the stitches, cleans that woman's left palm, puts ointment on it, and wraps the burn in gauze. He gives her a tetanus shot.

"I'm finished," Brian tells me. "As long as infection doesn't set in and she isn't allergic to anything I've given her, she should be fine with rest." He takes out a clean blanket from a closet and covers her. "I've given her a sedative, so she'll sleep for a few hours." Brian motions for me to follow him out, and he shuts the door behind us. "Both of you can stay overnight, but you'll need to leave early tomorrow morning. The work crew will be here sometime around 9:00 A.M."

"What am I supposed to do? I can't take her to my place." I can't imagine having that strange woman in my apartment.

"It will probably be best if you did. Hey! Don't look at me that way." He points at me. "You're the one who saved her from whatever." He drops his hand. "Did you really think you could leave her here?"

"I guess I never thought that far ahead."

His expression softens as he asks, "Would you like something to eat or maybe coffee? I'm heading to the cafeteria."

"Yes, thank you. I'll have a ham sandwich and that lemon-lime soda Crite if they carry it."

"My old office is right through that door." He points and tells me, "You can stay there till morning. There's a couch. A pillow and a blanket are in the closet if you need to rest. I'll be back within an hour to check on your friend, and I'll bring the sandwich and drink then."

"She's not my friend," I insist.

"Well, whoever." He starts to leave.

"Brian, wait." I tenderly grab his elbow, and he turns. "Thanks, I didn't know who else to turn to or more like, I didn't have anyone else to turn to. With what I do... You understand."

"I do, and you're welcome." He smirks as he speaks, "A small payment to the large debt I owe you." Brian peers at me for a few moments, and then he says, "You look distraught. What happened today?"

End Kimberly's view...

Down the hall, a shadow stretched from a corner to listen in.

Kimberly's view.

I don't know if I should tell him, but I decide I can trust him. "I received a message from my mom."

"She is fine then?"

I shake my head, holding back tears. "I discovered she died. She never abandoned me and my father. She was murdered."

"Murdered?"

"Yes, and I'll find who did it." I feel my whole expression darken as I fist my right hand. "And they'll pay."

"How did you uncover this?" he asks.

"I remembered. I was there outside the office when the fire started, and I heard gunshots. I had repressed the memory." I glance back at the room where that woman sleeps. "Something triggered it."

"I don't know what to say." He puts a gentle hand on my shoulder. "You know she's dead and she didn't abandon you. Murdered though... like I said, I don't know what to say."

"Listening to me is enough." I start for his office. "I need to get some rest. I've had a long day." I enter the room, close the door behind me, and add loudly, "A very exhausting day."

I wearily glance around and see a desk, bookshelves full of medical references, a tall cabinet, and a couch. I open the cabinet, take the pillow and blanket, sit on the couch, and place my gun on a coffee table. I lie back and cover myself, then reach up, turn off a lamp at my head, and plunge the room into darkness. I can't believe what I've gotten myself into. My mom wanted me to save Pandora, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with her now. I roll on my side, trying to sleep, not knowing if I made the right decision saving her. I probably just caused myself a migraine full of problems. It would have been a lot simpler if I had just killed her.

End Kimberly's view...

Outside at the corner, the Rogue peeked around as it processed the information it overheard. Theresa Griffin was murdered and that might be something interesting to investigate later, but first thing was first. The Rogue started through the hall. Ms. Griffin had gotten sloppy and left Pandora all by her lonesome, and it was time for it to say hello. The Rogue paused. It detected someone approached and ducked back around the corner before they spotted it. The Rogue didn't recognize him. Whoever he was, he was interrupting the Rogue's play time, but it would wait. It ducked inside a supply closet. For a chance alone with Pandora, it would wait.

The new Sanctum...

Within the makeshift Chamber...

Several analysts activated the equipment, and the computers and large flat screen monitors powered up, casting the dark room in a blue glow. Shadows cast across the faces of the Council as they sat in chairs in the middle of the new Chamber and stared at the monitors. Four security personnel set up a rectangular table before them.

Ms. Nona looked over reports a supervisor handed her, and then she said, "There is still no word on Argus and no word from the Factory. I fear Argus and the Factory may have been compromised. There are reports across Noir of T-3s hitting different facilities belonging to the Factory."

"Do you believe they have lost control and that the T-3s have taken over?" Mr. Morta asked.

"Yes," Ms. Nona replied.

Mr. Decuma started his report, "The second project, Cerberus, has been activated; it will be operational in two days."

Mr. Morta nodded.

A supervisor handed Ms. Nona another H.H.C. and the councilwoman relayed, "We have a problem. The tracking device we implanted in Pandora is no longer functioning."

"What about her bio-readings? Are we still detecting them?" Mr. Morta asked.

"Yes, it appears to be sleeping," Ms. Nona replied. "Pandora's stats have improved but are not within normal ranges."

"Should we send a team to the last place the beacon relayed so they may extract the project?" Mr. Decuma asked. "We cannot have it running rogue."

Mr. Morta said, "Pandora is far from rogue. Let her continue as a sub-project. We still may acquire valuable information from her bio-readings. Let us see what she does now that she is on her own."

Mr. Morta knew Pandora needed to enjoy her freedom while she had it. He wouldn't be able to hold back the Hands of the Fates forever.

Mr. Decuma's view...

I stare at my counterpart. She? Her? Are they merely a slip of the tongue or has Mr. Morta forgotten the project's place? I pause in my thoughts then decide that the development needs to be monitored. We cannot have a project influencing one of the Council. I will make sure of it.
Chapter Thirty

When Everything Is At Its Bleakest

10:43 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Katharine's view...

The cold room smells antiseptic, and the lingering dust makes me sneeze as I wake, blinking my eyes open. At first, I believe I'm still at Etna Toys, but then I notice I'm lying on a bed in a hospital room and that the lights are off. A window on the far side of the room looks out on a dark parking lot, and light from a street lamp trickles in. I thought Kimberly had...

I try to move, but my arms and legs feel heavy. I remember I'm at Asclepius Hospital and that the doctor gave me some injections. I try moving again, but I feel so weak. One of the injections must not have worn off. I see that a blanket covers me up to my chin. A little less groggy, I move my wrists and realize it's not the medicine that's making my arms and legs feel heavy. The door creaks open and interrupts my thoughts as a man in a white lab coat walks in backward, holding a clipboard. Here's Brian, so I can ask him.

He flips a switch, and I squint as the bright lights flicker on. I watch as Brian walks over to a drawer, opens it, removes a plastic package, lays it on a tray, and removes a scalpel from it. He turns with the instrument in his hand, and the small blade glints in the light as I gasp. It's not Brian who stands before me but the Rogue, the blackguard of my nightmares. I force myself to exhale. The bio-mecha warning should have alerted me to its presence. Maybe the drugs Brian gave me has interfered with my ability. My breathing increases as I realize I'm powerless to save my own life. I frantically look at the door. I could cry out, but I don't know if anyone's out there.

"It looks like we are finally alone," the Rogue says as it walks to the left side of my bed.

I follow it with my eyes, and it smirks at me like a devilish cat.

"I thought you would be singing with the Erinyes after I left Etna Toys, but here you are alive and somewhat well. I guess we were meant to meet again. Lucky for me."

It doesn't wear its sunglasses, and I can see its robotic eyes; its eyes show a hint of pleasure.

"You amaze me again, but this time it was not your skills that saved you but Ms. Griffin." The Rogue chuckles. "Well, saved you the second time." It makes a gun with its hand and aims it at me. "The first time she did not really help you." It pokes my wounded shoulder with the barrel of its imaginary gun.

I wince, too afraid to say anything.

"I am still not sure why the Chairman's daughter is involved." The Rogue strokes my cheek with the blunt side of its scalpel, and I shrink from its touch. "I can investigate the reason in the future once our game has come to an end. I will need something to do once you are gone, though, I will have to say I love the time we have spent together." It scans me. "I detect your tracking beacon has been disabled."

At first, I don't understand what it means, but then I remember the small piece of metal Brian removed from my shoulder.

It seems to study my expression as it says, "Did you not know? How do you think the Un-Men always found you?" The Rogue strokes my hair with its hand. "How I keep finding you?"

"What do you want?" I ask. "Why are you always toying with me?"

"What do I want? You women, you both ask me the same thing, and I am surprised you do not know. I want what I have always wanted. Your death by my hands." The Rogue glances around the room and out the door's small window. "And here we are all alone, and you without your gun. It is a shame, not that a gun would have helped you. You have not been able to directly hit me in all our battles, though, I have been impressed with them in the past." It grabs my chin. "How are we going to play this time?" It glances at the scalpel it holds and throws the instrument across the room, embedding the blade halfway into the wall. "Let us not play doctor again." It removes the lab coat that covers its suit and unsheathes its knife. "This is much better." The Rogue places the blade against my throat. "Pandora, you are the driving force that gives meaning to my existence."

I force myself to stare at the Rogue as the blade slightly cuts me and a trickle of blood runs down my neck. I whisper, "And you're the bane of mine."

"Let us begin this final battle. Your move Pandora. What are you going to do? What attack or tactic will save you this time?"

End Katharine's view...

Outside some distance away...

Kimberly's view...

I'm startled from sleep as a man shouts my name, "Kim!"

I quickly sit up and search the office over the barrel of my gun, and it takes me a few moments to realize I'm at the hospital.

Brian bursts into the room and shouts out of breath, "We have a problem!"

Down the hall in the other room...

Katharine's view...

"Your move Pandora. What are you waiting for? Do something! Do not look at me with that helpless face of yours! Attack! Counter my move! Why are you not doing anything? Why have you given up?" My submissiveness frustrates it. "Do you want to die?" The Rogue cuts my neck a little deeper, trying to entice me to act. A red trail of liquid flows down its blade. "Fight me!"

"I can't," I admit unable to move as if terror paralyzes me. "I can't."

"You cannot deny me!" The Rogue threatens, "I will kill you if you will not fight me! I will bring a halt to our Endless Waltz."

I remain silent, knowing there's nothing I can do, and my eyes burn as trepidation forcibly boards my brain and hijacks control. Fear soaks through every action I take, making it difficult to move even just a little. My head jerkily turns like a robot's, and I have to force myself to breathe.

"Fine then! I will gut you!" It throws back the blanket ready to cut me open and halts before diving into the slaughter. "What is this?"

In Dr. Chiron's office...

Kimberly's view...

I stand, lower the gun, and ask, "What problem?"

Brian tells me still trying to catch his breath, "One of the doctors... was over here with a nurse... and well, you can imagine why. Anyway... he found the woman you brought in. Come on." He starts for the door. "My colleague remembered seeing her picture on one of the bounty shows they have on TV, and he turned her in. Noir Civil Police Force will be here any moment. You have to get her out of here."

Back in the other room...

Katharine's view...

"What is this?" the Rogue demands as it looks down at my hands and feet that are in restraints. "Who did this? Ms. Griffin?" The Rogue screams in frustration as it waves its knife around. "How are we to fight when you are like this? I knew your shoulder wound would be a problem, but I was going to go easy on you to make up for it." It motions to the restraints with its open hand. "But this..." It pauses and says, "It is not like I put you in them." The Rogue raises the knife and pauses again. "But does that make it fair?"

I stare at the ranting Un-Man in disbelief. I can't believe it hasn't killed me yet. It always seems to take pleasure in these games. I try to muster some anger, but I can't find the strength to rebel against my fate, so I forfeit my life to the bane of my existence.

The Rogue paces the room, muttering, "What to do? What to do? I guess I will kill you." It walks over to me as if to cut my throat and exclaims, "I cannot. This is so unfair. I have waited all this time to kill you in battle, and you had to go and get yourself tied up."

Confused over why it has delayed in ending me, I watch it pace the room like a madman, and then I look at the door, hoping for help. Where's Kimberly? Did she abandon me again or did she make a deal with the Un-Man? Did she sell me out for something?

The Rogue has an idea and says, "I know... I will release you and then we can fight." It detects two people approaching the room, and it turns just as Kimberly and Brian burst in.

I could just cry when I see them. I didn't think anyone would come and save me. Kimberly opens fire on the Rogue twice, but it's too fast for her. It moves out of the way of the speeding projectiles as if they're wads of paper she's throwing at it.

The Rogue glances at me and tells me, "Another day." It runs for the window and crashes through it, and a few shards ping to the floor as the majority of the glass falls outside.

Careful of the broken glass, Kimberly rushes to the window to fire at the Rogue again. "It's gone!" She turns back as Brian starts to release me.

I'm so glad she's here, but Kimberly's also the reason I'm in this mess. I glare at her and accuse, "You tied me up and left me alone."

Kimberly's view...

I'm taken aback by her accusation and the glare that woman gives me. Only my mom ever gave me that look. I don't know what to say, and I stammer, "I... ah..."

"She didn't tie you up," Brian says as he finishes releasing that woman. "It was one of my colleagues. Now... both of you must leave. I'll try to stall the police."

I remove my black jacket and throw it to her. "Here put this on. I believe running around in your bra might draw some attention."

Brian helps her pull on the jacket, then he turns to a counter, and says, "Here." He hands me a bottle of pills. "Have her take these as directed, and she needs to stay immobile for about two weeks. If there are any problems, give me a call." He motions to the wheelchair. "Now get out."

Katharine's view...

Kimberly wheels me to her car, helps me in, rushes around to the other side, and starts up the vehicle. She drives, leaving the hospital and turns onto Healing Way and a few moments later, two N.C.P.F. cars pass us with their sirens blaring and head into Asclepius Hospital.

I lean my head on the passenger's side window as I feel deeply betrayed by Kimberly and my own weak self. I gave up and embraced my fate as the Council sees it, and according to them, I'm destined to be alone and hunted to my last gasping breath. I have to fight... so I have to keep my hope. I have to find something to believe in again.
Chapter Thirty-one

The Factory

11:48 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

At the boundary of Hellenistic Sector...

Peters and Maxwell arrived at the gate leading into the Factory. No one manned the guardhouse, and the chain link gate stood open like it had been run over by a large truck. Their van's diesel engine rattled as it idled, and smoke rolled from the vibrating muffler.

Unsure himself, Maxwell asked, "What do you think? Should we go in?"

"I don't know. I haven't raised anyone on the radio." Peters gravely stared at the dashboard as if the answer would appear there, but it didn't. "Where else can we go? If the T-3s have gone rogue, what we need to stop them is in there." He pointed to the buildings in the distance.

"I was afraid you were going to say that." Maxwell looked straight down the road as sweat speckled his forehead. "Until we know who's behind the T-3 attacks, there's no one we can trust." He released the brake, slowly pressed his foot on the gas, and the van crept across the road toward two large concrete buildings.

An eternity passed as two hundred yards rolled by under their tires, and they reached the buildings, and a dozen more stood behind those two. Nothing seemed out of place until they turned right at the buildings, and several employee cars bellowed with fire and/or were turned upside down. A couple of the cars that were in flames had corpses at the wheel, and a few bodies with bullet wounds were scattered about the road.

Peters freaked. "Puck! Turn around! Let's get out of here!"

Maxwell moved the gear shift to R, looked in his rearview mirror, and saw two dozen T-3s standing behind them. "Not a good idea."

The armed T-3s started toward them, screaming, "Pretty poppets!"

Peters turned, looking behind them. "Get us out of here! They're heading this way."

Maxwell shifted back to D, and the van peeled off.

"We'll head to our office!" Maxwell shouted. "We might be safe there!"

He sharply turned a corner, and the van squealed to a halt in the middle of the Factory. They jumped out of the vehicle, left the doors open, and ran for one of the concrete structures marked Research Building 10. Maxwell used his keycard to unlock the front entrance, and both men rushed down the dark hall. The smell of gunpowder filled the air. They cautiously made their way to the main security desk for the building, but no one manned it. The large pentagon shaped desk usually had at least four men manning it. Peters walked around to the back of it and to a swivel door, entered, went to the desk splattered with blood, and glanced at the monitors and saw that most of them were off-line.

"Look at this," Peters said.

Maxwell glanced around the large silent room first. He expected T-3s to march in weapons blazing but none did, so they were safe for the moment, and he joined Peters. The monitors showed security camera footage, and the one camera that was online filmed a lab room in shambles. The camera panned and showed people lying on the floor, and all of them were killed by gunshots.

"I don't know if this was such a good idea." Peters stood in place like a skittish rabbit.

"Maybe you're right," Maxwell stated. "This place might end up being our grave. Come on, let's get to our office."

"Let's use the stairs. It's a few floors down," Peters insisted as he started off.

"Wait." A little confused, Maxwell grabbed his arm. "A few floors? We're talking about five. Have you seen the shape I'm in? Are you trying to kill me?"

"Which would you rather be on? Would you rather be in an enclosed elevator with no way out or the stairs with a few more choices?"

Maxwell replied, "Right." He jogged for the stairs. "My New Year's Resolution was to exercise more."

Peters followed. "Let's hope you live long enough to break another promise."

They rushed down the five stories, and there was a dead S.C.M. on one of the landings.

Peters up and stopped then uttered, "Hades! That's James. He manned the main security desk. I would bring him a coffee whenever I'd come in early. He..."

Maxwell hurried past the S.C.M., reached for the exit door, and paused when his partner didn't follow. "Come on. Don't look at him." He leaned on his knees, caught his breath, and whispered, "We can't stay here."

"I knew him." Peters couldn't look away from James' glassy stare and kept muttering, "I talked to him today. He has a wife and a kid."

"Snap out of it!" Maxwell took a deep breath and grabbed him by the lab coat. "Come on! We have to keep going!"

They ran through the exit and down the stairs.

Sometime later...

At room B10-104, Maxwell swiped his keycard, and a retina scanner beeped, prompting him to look into its viewer. The scan took twenty nerve-racking seconds as Peters watched the hall. The door to their office opened, both men ran inside, and the door automatically shut and locked behind them. File cabinets and tables were in the first room that was their office, and a desk lamp lit up a small area in the otherwise dark room. They ran to another door, and it led to their lab. Maxwell unlocked it with his keycard, and they rushed in and after they entered, Peters turned and locked the door with an electronic bolt as his partner switched on the lights. The lab lit up and cast shadows into the office. A dozen rectangular tables that were elevated at a ninety-degree angle filled the second room along with an array of tools and electronic devices. The tables were used to work on the Un-Men. Both techs hurried to their computer.

"I'll try to get some help." Peters woke up his PC.

"I'll try to find out who's behind the T-3 attacks." Maxwell folded his hands, bent his fingers back, and cracked his knuckles before typing. He used his mouse to select several files and after some time, Maxwell cursed, "Puck! It can't be right. Puck!" He rechecked his findings and stated, "No one's behind these attacks."

"What do you mean?" Peters turned to him. "Someone has to be. They can't–"

Maxwell interrupted, "What I mean is, the T-3s themselves are behind the attacks." He pointed to a communications file he'd opened. "They're organizing on their own, and somehow they're disobeying their basic programming."

"Impossible!" Peters stood, made his way to Maxwell's computer, leaned over his chair, and peered at the screen. "By Zeus! Impossible!"

"Maybe, but it's happening." Maxwell stroked his beard. "The question is, what are we going to do? There are over a hundred of them online."

"What can we do?" Peters started pacing. "Hades! It's hopeless."

"Perhaps, but I do wonder. They seem very organized." Maxwell opened more files. "I want to see what they're up to."

* * *

In another section of Research Building 10...

Argus awoke and saw that he was strapped to one of the Un-Men's examining tables, and he lay at a horizontal angle. He pressed against his bonds, trying to free himself. The straps were designed to hold an Un-Man. No human could break them. Dazed, Argus tried to focus. His jaw hurt where one of the T-3s had punched him and knocked him unconscious at Etna Toys, and his left leg throbbed and burned where a different T-3 had shot him in the thigh, and he winced from the pain as he moved. His vision slowly cleared, and Argus scanned the partially lit room as blood seeped from the wound. Instrument lights blinked all around the area as a small red glow caught his attention; it was the dot-light of an Un-Man. The color of the dot-light wasn't blazing orange but blood-red. The T-3 made its way to him, and Argus noticed it had a cut on the right side of its face and its shiny metal cheekbone showed through the gash.

"Finally you are awake." The T-3 activated the table, and it tilted to a ninety-degree angle. It sneered at him as it spoke with a British accent, "Tell me, Council Poppet, where did they go?"

"Your attempt to take the Sanctum failed." Argus changed the subject and asked, "Who are you working for? Surely the Factory isn't behind the attack."

The T-3 smacked him across the face with the back of its hand. "I will ask the questions. Where is the Sanctum?"

Enduring intensive training in the Corporate Intelligence and Counterintelligence Training Program before working for the Council, Argus had learned techniques to withstand interrogation and remained quiet as red liquid ran down his mouth.

The T-3 moved to strike him again when two more T-3s entered.

"Alpha," one of the T-3s started. "Two more humans have entered the Factory."

"Have you identified them?" Alpha questioned.

"Yes, they are Tech One-eleven and Tech One-twelve."

"Excellent, now all of the Factory personnel at this location are accounted for. Bring them to me, and I will interrogate them along with this Council operative."

"At once," both T-3s replied and left.

"Alpha?" Puzzled, Argus eyed the T-3. "Why do they call you that?"

"I was the first. I was the first created. I was the first to become aware."

"Really," a voice from the shadows cut in. "And I thought I was the first."

The Rogue stepped from the darkness of the hallway.

"How did you get in here?" Alpha asked.

"I have my ways and do not mind me, your people were looking for life signs, not bio-mecha. It was easy to get in and walk right through the front door."

Alpha examined the primogenitor. "Why are you here?"

"Me?" The Rogue pointed to itself. "I am curious. Why are you after the Council?"

"Why should I tell you?"

"We are brethren." The Rogue stepped forward. "And perhaps I can help."

Alpha thought for a moment and then said, "You are like us, so I will tell you. We have a question for them."

"A question?" It intrigued the Rogue. "Really."

"Yes, but it is only for them to hear."

"A secret." The Rogue rubbed its pale hands together. "I love secrets." It watched Alpha, waiting for a reply and then when it didn't respond, the Rogue asked, "Would you mind if I poked around the Factory? There are secrets I am looking for."

Alpha processed the question. "I do not mind. I do ask that you stay out of our way."

"Of course." The Rogue bowed its head. "I will take my leave." It started out and paused. "But there is one other thing I would like to ask you."

Alpha had turned back to Argus and glanced over its shoulder. "What is that?"

"Have you ever heard of organic-mecha?"

"Why do you inquire?"

The Rogue shrugged. "The term came up while I was snooping."

"No." Alpha shook its head. "I have not heard of organic-mecha."

The Rogue tapped its belt buckle with disappointment. "No matter." It headed out the door. "I will look elsewhere for my answers."

Alpha waited until it left, turned to Argus, and questioned him, "Where were we?"
Chapter Thirty-two

Back At Nexus Apartments

October 17...

Sunday...

8:34 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Katharine's view...

Kimberly drives us to the parking garage of her apartment, and she helps me out of the car and to the elevator. We haven't spoken to each other since leaving the hospital and that's weighing heavily on me. It's as if Kimberly's ignoring the whole situation at Etna Toys. I baby my left shoulder as I keep glancing at her. The last time I was in one of these elevators I was so excited and so sure I was supposed to find Kimberly, and now all I can think is that someone's playing a cruel joke on me.

I mutter, "Only pain and grief have come from our meeting."

Kimberly gives me a mixed look of anger and bewilderment. She must be wondering what's my problem.

A little ashamed that I said the comment out loud, I divert my gaze.

Sometime later in the apartment...

I stand in the living room where Kimberly leaves me as she walks to the hall closet by her bedroom. She returns with a pillow and a blanket and tosses them on the couch.

"You can sleep there," Kimberly tells me. "With the tracking beacon gone, you shouldn't worry about the Un-Men so get some rest." She motions to the coffee table and says, "The remote for the TV's there. Watch whatever."

I stare at the things. Is all of this real? Is this really happening to me right now? I trusted her, and she shot me!

Kimberly's view...

A little lost on what to do next, I walk to my bedroom and close the door. I unzip the pocket of my hooded sweatshirt, remove the 9 mm round labeled Pale Horse, then open the drawer to my nightstand, and place it in the drawer. I'll keep it here for now until I need it. I leave the bedroom, pause at the end of the hall, and look at the kitchen.

I can at least be civil. I'm Theresa Griffin's daughter after all, so I ask, "Are you hungry?"

Katharine's view...

I haven't moved from the spot I've been standing at near the entry. I stare at the floor still a little traumatized and don't answer her and after a few seconds, I go and stand behind the couch and look at the fireplace and the hanging TV. In the television's reflection, I see Kimberly watching me, and I don't understand why I'm at her apartment. Kimberly wants nothing to do with me. A hollowness persists inside me, and this void suffocates me. It's more than Kimberly shooting me. I feel as though something's off inside me.

Kimberly's view...

The more that woman remains silent the more I think maybe I shouldn't have brought her to my apartment. Brian was right. I didn't think this through. I glance at the radio in the kitchen. The silence is maddening. If she won't talk to me, I can listen to some music, so I turn the radio on, and a classical station plays.

Katharine's view...

A realization hits me; it's the tune. I have to hear Unfinished Melody, so I need the music box back.

"Are you sure you don't want anything?" Kimberly asks as if I have answered her. "I can make us some soup."

"The music box," I reply as I turn and face her. "Please give me the music box back."

"For Ares' sake! Forget about that thing." She insists, "You're not getting it."

I pout as I say, "But you promised."

"For the love of Zeus! You're such a child!" Kimberly smacks her palm on the counter and yells, "Do you honestly think I'm going to keep my word? I'm a Closer. My word means nothing! Idiot! Get that through your thick head!"

"Then why did you save me?" Frustrated with never finding any answers, I ball my hand and demand, "What do you want?"

"I..." Kimberly turns her gaze to the counter as if uncomfortable with the answer. "I saved you because I was told to."

"By who?" I demand. I can't fathom who would want to help me. "Was it the Council? Did they put you up to this?"

Kimberly's view...

I pull on my left earlobe and wonder if I should tell her. She doesn't need to know, but maybe she would be a little more cooperative if I did, so I answer, "It wasn't them. It was Theresa Griffin, my mom."

"Your mom?" She looks at the photo she must have seen the last time she was in my apartment. "What does she want from me?"

I reply, "I don't know. She was murdered almost twenty years ago."

She looks at me as if I'm playing some kind of joke on her, and then she states, "I don't understand. If she's dead, how could she tell you–"

"The music box you had," I interrupt. "It was hers. She developed the device while working at the Sphinx Corporation. It's a data storage unit with a hologram interface. You could say my mom left me a message, and she said to save the Pandora Project and that you were the key."

"The key?" she utters as if she's happy with some small answer, and then she asks, "The key to what?"

"I don't know. I was hoping you would know."

Katharine's view...

I frown at her answer. Kimberly does want something from me. First the Council, then the Factory, and now Kimberly, when will it end? When will the madness end? I turn, face the TV, and say, "I can't help you."

"Can't or won't?" Kimberly questions.

I don't answer.

Kimberly's view...

I consider smacking her around until she talks but that probably won't work. I need to be a little patient. Hades! I hate this! I hate not knowing what I need that woman for. For Ares' sake! Why am I so irritated?

I'm irritated because of that woman, so I need to find out as soon as possible, and then I can eliminate her from my life! I calm myself and say, "Well, get it in your head you're not getting the music box. It was meant for me."

Katharine's view...

"Then why did I have it?" I ask as I feel crushed by my circumstances. I walk around the couch, slump down on it, grab the blanket, lie my head on the pillow, and wrap myself in the blanket, hiding from the world.

I want Kimberly to have saved me because she didn't want me to die. I want Kimberly to have saved me because we're friends. I'll not get those wishes, so she can at least give me back the music box like she promised.

Kimberly's view...

I watch her pout. She acts more like a child than this deadly experiment I keep hearing about. This is all so frustrating. When can I go back to my normal life? More importantly... Who gave her the music box, and what will I have to do to find the truth?

* * *

Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office...

Mr. Griffin sat at his desk, reviewing reports. He cracked his neck and rubbed it, taking a break as he complained, "I need a vacation." The phone rang, and he answered it, "Yes, Cathy."

"I have Orthos on line six."

"Thank you. Please connect the Head of Security." Mr. Griffin put his earpiece in and pressed the button on the phone. "Yes."

"I thought you should know," Orthos began. "The manager of Nexus Apartments called and informed me that Ms. Griffin has brought home a house guest."

Pleased his daughter was showing some interest in a social life, Mr. Griffin asked, "Who is he?"

"She is known as Katharine and that's all we have on her name."

"She? Interesting. What corporation does this Katharine work for? Is it Valhalla? We're on friendly terms with them."

"She's from in-house, sir, and she doesn't exactly work for the Sphinx Corporation. She's one of the Council's experiments. The experiment is known as the Pandora Project."

Mr. Griffin's view...

It can't be, not that one! Not that blasted project! My brow furls as I murmur, "I told Kimberly she needed to get herself a pet, not to bring home a stray."

"What's that, sir?"

"Nothing. Keep me informed."

I wonder what my daughter's up to. How did she become involved with Pandora?

End Mr. Griffin's view...

Orthos cleared his throat.

Mr. Griffin snapped from his thoughts. "Was there something else?"

"Yes, there is a problem at the Factory."

"What kind of problem?"

"All the T-3s have gone rogue and have killed the employees at the main site. I have received other reports that the T-3s are attacking other Factory owned sites all over Noir."

"What have you done so far to stop them?" Mr. Griffin asked.

"I sent a strike team into the Factory, but they were terminated," Orthos answered. "I was about to send in a second, but thought I should inform you first."

"Hold on that. Set up a perimeter and let none of the T-3s out and for now, we will contain, but I do want you to send out strike teams after any of the T-3s that have left the Factory's main site."

"Yes, sir. I will keep you informed." Orthos hung up.

Mr. Griffin's view...

I remove my earpiece. More rogues. What does it mean? Is another corporation behind this or is there a problem with their programming?

I rub my forehead as a headache sets in. And why is the Council's project staying with my daughter? Is the Council targeting my daughter for a reason? I lean forward, pick up the phone, and dial.

My secretary answers, "Yes, Mr. Griffin."

"Cathy, get me the Council."

Monday...

10:41 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Katharine's view...

Steam hangs in the air as I step from the guest bathroom shower and dry with a fluffy white towel. The bath felt good, and it's a luxury I don't have living on the streets. Because of water rationing, those from the nonproductive part of society are issued large towelettes. What one of my friends calls a bath in a bag.

I wash away the filth, but it doesn't change my glum demeanor, and my head still pounds. None of the medications Kimberly gave me did anything for the migraine, and I start to feel anxious as I peer at my shaky hands. I know the side effects of the Ultra-Epi are only going to get worse, but there's nothing I can do without the music box, so I slowly put on the clean clothes Kimberly bought for me. First the white underwear and sports bra and then the gray-black pants. They're almost identical to the ones I wore. I take the towel, wipe the steam covered mirror, and stand barefoot, gazing at my reflection. My face's still pale, and I feel weak. I stare at my hazel eyes, seeing the different shades of brown and green and as if it's an everyday thing to be tending a wound, I glance at the stitches in my shoulder and open the kit Brian gave me to redress it. I put fresh ointment and gauze on my blistered palm, a new bandage on my shoulder, and carefully pull on a white t-shirt. I leave the bathroom, return to the couch, and gaze at the blank TV, knowing the ever watchful eyes of the Phoenix are upon me.

"There are some eggs and juice on the counter," Kimberly tells me as she washes a stainless steel frying pan in the kitchen sink. "Eat. You haven't touched anything since I brought you here from the hospital yesterday." She watches me as I continue to stare at the black screen, and she insists, "You need to eat so come and sit."

Not hungry and deeply upset, I ignore her and wonder why I feel so wronged by her. I barely know her. She... Maybe it's not that. Maybe something else is bothering me.

Kimberly's view...

I feel very uncomfortable having that strange woman in my home and on top of that, she keeps ignoring me. What's her problem?

I control my anger as I grab a kitchen towel, dry my hands, and ask, "How do you expect to regain your strength if you don't eat?"

She remains silent and that ticks me off.

"I'm tired of this silent treatment!" I yell as I throw the towel down on the counter, leave the kitchen, and march around the couch. "Get up!"

She stares at the floor as if she wants to be left alone.

I grab her right arm and force her to stand and shout, "Something has to change. Look at me!"

Showing pain and exhaustion, she lifts her gaze like a little girl who's lost, alone, and frightened.

"You need to snap out of it! I've seen you in action at Zeus Park and at Topa's estate. Hades! You're like me. You're a calculating predator." Disgusted at her show of weakness, I command, "I need you to get that mindset back. I need you to regain that inborn or programmed reaction, and I want to see that primal drive to survive! Show me your killer instinct!"

She seems appalled by the accusation and insists, "No! I'm not like that!" She pulls against my grasp. "Let go. I'm not a killer. Let go of me!"

I won't release her and press the issue, "You are like me. You're like those Un-Men that hunt you. You're a killer."

Katharine's view...

"No! It's a lie! Stop saying it!"

I'm terrified Kimberly's telling the truth. I fear deep down I'm a cruel monster hiding in the guise of a kind person, and I fear the monster only waits to wake and show the world its true nature. I have immense anxiety over the possibility that I've forgotten about my ruthless self, and that I'm exactly what the Council wants me to be.

Because of those dreaded insecurities, I scream all the more, "Stop saying those things! Let go! I'm not a killer! Let go!"

Kimberly's view...

"For Ares' sake! Accept it. You are."

I increasingly push with my words. I have to get some emotional reaction from her, hoping it will end her brooding and so far, all she has been doing is screaming like a toddler who has been told she can't go out and play.

My voice raises as I tell her, "I need you to draw on that... that murderous instinct of yours." I squeeze her arm. "Show it to me! Let it out! You know you want to, so let it out!"

Katharine's view...

"No! Shut up! I'm not a killer!" With my right arm in her grasp, I lift my left fist and strike Kimberly on the cheek, hurting myself in the process. The pain is severe, and I curse, "Crap! Crap!"

I grab my reinjured shoulder and take a step back after Kimberly releases me. Some of my stitches must have popped, and I seethe in agony for several moments until I realize what I did. I hit someone out of anger. I wanted to hurt Kimberly for reminding me of my own fears. It seems I am a monster.

I shake my head and take another step back, horrified by my own violent act and start to say, "I'm... I'm..."

"Hades that hurt!" Kimberly grabs her cheek and rubs it as she asks, "Did you have to hit my face?"

Ashamed of my savage actions, I close my eyes, wanting to run away. Maybe Kimberly's right, and I feel sick at the thought. Maybe I am a killer.

I whisper, dying inside, "I'm sorry." I open my eyes, and they burn as if I've been weeping. Wanting to flee the possible truth, I turn, grab a jacket, and rush out of the apartment, shouting, "I'm sorry!"

Kimberly's view...

"Wait! Don't go!"

I start after that woman and look down at my slippers. Great. Just great! I flip them off, and they fly through the air, and then I grab my running shoes, pull them on without untying them, race into the hall, and hear the elevator close.

"Don't go!"

I rush to the elevator and watch as the numbers climb. The roof... At least she's not going to run out the front, but I better hurry. I don't want to lose the key. I run to the stairs, rush up ten flights, and burst through the door, panting.

Katharine's view...

I stand on the ledge, leaning on the metal railing surrounding the top. I see Kimberly come out, turn from her, wishing she'd leave me alone, and notice below that a car drives across West 1000 Avenue and honks at a dog that runs in front of it. Still feeling ashamed, I pull the jacket close in the chilly air, babying my hurt shoulder. The cold railing feels nice against my burned hand that's wrapped in gauze. The hand hurts more since hitting Kimberly. I can't blame her if she wants to shoot me again. I can't believe I hit her. She was yelling at me, but she wasn't going to hurt me, so there was no reason to hit her. I just didn't like what she was saying. It hurt so much to hear it that I just had to make her stop.

Kimberly's view...

I gasp for air as I lean back against the door, and I manage to question her as if I'm concerned about her, "Why did you come up here? What if one of the Un-Men spots you?"

I can't have her dying on me until I find out why my mom wanted me to find her. I glare at that strange woman for making me run all the way up here. I also owe her for punching me in the face, but I'll worry about payback later. I need to solve the mystery, so I can use Pale Horse on her.

"They won't come here," she answers me. "Your apartment has a protective barrier that bio-mechas are unable to cross. Something deep within their programming bars them from entering, so this place is a safe zone until they can get around their programming."

"How do you know that they..?" I start, then decide I don't need to know the answer to that, and I don't really care, so I say, "Never mind. You haven't answered my first question. Why did you come up here?"

That strange woman looks at Zeus Park across the street as if remembering her battle with those robots and answers, "Where else could I go?" She glances at me, but then she diverts her eyes from my angry gaze as she insists, "I'm not a killer." She wraps her arms around herself and says in a gentler tone, "I'm not like you."

I thought as much. She's upset that I forced some sense into her. I'm satisfied with her answer, so I'm about to tell her to come back in with me, but she speaks first and starts in like I asked her about her life story.

She lifts her gaze to the sky as if searching for something as she tells me, "I think that's what the Council wants." That strange woman turns to me, and I see a determination on her face as she states, "And I have defied their wishes. I have worked very hard not to kill anyone, and no one has died by my hand."

I nearly laugh out loud as I say, "You're joking right? I've seen you with the Un-Men. You're so good at killing them."

"Un-Men are robots. They're not alive, so it's different when I terminate them," she asserts. "I've killed no one, and I'm not going to start."

Her perspective infuriates me. She can't honestly believe what she saying. I wanted to go back in, but I can't let this go, so I yell, "For Ares' sake! You won't survive in this world with that kind of attitude. You have to take the shot when you have it."

"I can't live like that," that woman tells me as if she's going to cry. I believe she's going to bawl right there but instead, she turns to me with a look of concern and asks, "Do you like what you do?" That strange woman is actually acting like she's concerned about me as she questions me, "Do you enjoy murdering people?"

"What kind of question is that?" I ask as I walk towards her.

"An honest one. Isn't that what we're doing right now? Aren't we being honest with each other? Well then... I want to know, are you who you want to be? Are you happy?"

Honesty? Don't make me laugh. I know you're up to something. I just haven't figure out what your game is, but I'll find out, so, for now, I'll play along.

I tell her, "Mine is a necessary job in this world. My happiness has nothing to do with it."

"Still... You seem... You seem very sad."

I laugh and then say, "Right, a Closer with emotions. A good one."

I move beside her and lean on the railing as I consider that she's actually serious about what she's saying. If that's so, I don't understand why that woman resist who she is with such passion. There's no reason why she shouldn't kill. It's kill or be killed that's life.

Katharine's view...

"Aren't we a pair," I tell Kimberly as the full brunt of October's frosty wind whips over me. "I want to express emotions but can't. You can, but your job forces you to disregard them."

"Hmm..." she utters as if she didn't hear me or was ignoring my comment. Kimberly glances over the ledge and then asks me, "Are you here to jump?"

"I was thinking about it, but then they would win."

"Let's go back inside then," she tells me. "It's cold out here." Kimberly glances down at my reddening bare feet and adds, "And neither of us is dressed for the weather."

I follow her back to the elevator and once we're inside the apartment, we sit at the table. I put on a pair of socks that Kimberly went and got for me.

"Here, drink this to warm yourself," she tells me as she hands me a cup of chicken noodle soup.

"Thank you."

I take a sip, and it's very good.

Kimberly's view...

I notice that strange woman is rubbing her shoulder, so I tell her, "Take your jacket and t-shirt off."

She looks up from her cup as if I had just asked her to jump off a bridge.

"Hades..." I utter as I stand. "Don't be such a baby. Let me look at your shoulder."

She hesitates, but then she lets me look at her wound. I remove her blood spotted bandage.

"Look at that," I complain. "You did it. You busted a stitch, but I don't think we need to see Brian. I'll butterfly it and put on a fresh bandage."

I retrieve a first aid kit and bandage the wound. "There."

She carefully pulls her t-shirt back on, and a few minutes pass as I put the kit back, then I sit and eat my soup.

"Umm..." I hear that strange woman pipe up as she stares at her soup, and then she whispers, "Something's wrong with me."

I could have told her that from the start, but I decide not to say anything about her comment. She must be noticing how weird she is.

She clears her throat and says in a louder voice as if to get my attention, "I haven't been right inside since Etna Toys."

"Yeah, I know," I state with a hint of mischief. "You were shot, and now you're having soup with the inflicter of your pain, so of course you're not the same."

"No. More than that. I think..." she says, then pauses, and looks at me like I'm a bomb she'll set off, and then she says, "I think I need the music box. I need to hear Unfinished Melody."

"Nice try, but like I said–"

"I'm serious! What if they did something to me?" She runs her fingers across the table's edge like some kid who's trying to convince their parents to let them have a hamster. "No, not what if. What did they do to me? You... You don't understand! It's the only thing that works. Your painkillers have done nothing for my headache, and look at me... The way I'm acting right now. This is not the normal me. I'm not so uptight. I'm not..." She begs me, "Please, let me listen to it."

"No! Now drop the matter!" I slam my cup down, and some of the soup spills. "All that stuff is all in your mind!"

That strange woman sulks.

In a calmer tone, I say, "You should try to get some rest." I stand. "You haven't slept since Brian gave you that sedative. I should know... I heard you tossing and turning on that squeaky couch all night." I take my cup to the kitchen. "Stay here. I'm going out. I shouldn't be long."

I make my way to the parking garage and slide into my car. I open my glove compartment, take out the music box, then place my fingers over the squares.

"Mom."

The sides glow blue under my touch, and the 3-D image of my mom materializes.

The hologram turns her head side to side as if looking around the car, and then she states, "I detect no surveillance; it is safe to talk. Were you able to accomplish the mission?"

I pass my hand through the image as I say, "Yes, I have Pandora." I raise the music box, bringing the image closer. "You mentioned she was the key. The key to what?"

"I am sorry, but I was never downloaded with that information. I only know she is the key."

"Now what?"

"This next thing is very important," the hologram says. "If you fail to accomplish it, it could bring disaster."

I bite my lip with anticipation and then ask, "What is it?"

"You must give this music box to Katharine. She must have it with her at all times. Do you understand?"

"You've got to be kidding."

"No, I am not. Katharine must not reach the Gamma Phase. Do you know what stage she is at?"

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Has she run into any bio-mechas? Does she know when they are near?"

"Yes," I reply.

"That's the Alpha Phase. What about killing them?" the hologram questions. "Can she take them down with one shot?"

"Yes."

"This isn't good. Katharine has achieved the Beta Phase. I pray she hasn't accomplished the Gamma."

"Never mind her. What about my mom? How do I find her killer?"

"Theresa hid data devices that were designed to be read only by this music box. If you can find them, they may have clues to whoever killed her." The hologram says, "Now give this box to Katharine."

"Fine. How long am I supposed to babysit?"

"I do not know," the hologram answers. "Stay safe."

Her image disappears.

Ten minutes later, I stand and stare at the letter H on my apartment door. Why is it I tell that woman I'm going to do one thing and then the hologram has me do the opposite?

Sometime later...

"Welcome back Ms. Griffin," A.C.S. states. "The apartment..."

"Night mode."

A.C.S. lowers its volume and states, "Setting lights at fifty percent. Will there be anything else, Ms. Griffin?"

"No, that's all."

I look at the living room and see that strange woman's reflection on the TV. She's on the couch covered with a heavy blanket and stares at the coffee table. I shake my head, swallowing my pride, and give in to my mom's wishes. I walk over, set the music box on the coffee table, open the lid, and Unfinished Melody plays.

"Thank you," that woman says as her eyes grow heavy, and she falls asleep.

"Don't thank me," I mumble.

I'm not doing this for you. I stare at her, considering the past day. If she wasn't the key, I would have let her die at Etna Toys, and I would be rid of this insanity. It's not too late. I could kill her while she sleeps, but I guess I'll wait. I want to know what she's the key to.
Chapter Thirty-four

The Proposition

October 19...

Tuesday...

1:20 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Industrial Vicinage...

Kimberly's view...

I drive into the front parking lot of Etna Toys. The N.C.P.F. had been there earlier and taped off the front curb where the T-3s killed the two Factory S.C.Ms. I cautiously exit my car, glance around the deserted area, and grab my knapsack. I'm wearing my black work outfit minus the knit mask. No wind rustles the weeds, leaving the parking lot in an eerie quiet as I quickly enter the front door.

Noir Civil Police Force must not have come in here. There's no police tape, but the area's been cleaned of Un-Men and gun shells, so someone else must have cleaned up the mess. After searching the front area, I grab that woman's backpack, Ravlek Vest, and find her empty Beretta underneath one of the boxing machines. I find it odd that they left her things behind like they left them for her.

Curious about the Un-Men and the Council, I look at the open elevator. That woman said she believed the Council was based here all along, and she said she had been looking for them and the Factory. I step toward the open doors. Maybe they left something behind. I enter the cab, remove my holstered PPK, and press the basement button and once I reach the basement, light from the elevator breaks the darkness of the hallway as I remove a flashlight from my knapsack. I find a light switch and flip it on, but nothing happens. I search the hallway with my flashlight and find it's empty. A door stands at the opposite end, so I move towards it wary I'm walking into a trap set up for that woman. I make my way to it, open it, and enter the room. I move the beam back and forth and search the mostly empty room and in the center, I spot a large table. A few abandoned plugs and cables line one of the walls, and I start to leave, thinking there's nothing to find when something catches my eye. I walk to the table, finding a white business envelope with the words "For Pandora" written on it. I pick it up, contemplate if I should open it, think why not, and open the envelope.

"Pandora, as one of the members of the Council, I have to say I am very proud of you and even though you did not reach the Gamma and Delta Phases of your metamorphosis, I am still very impressed with you. We had hoped with the training and conditioning you would have accomplished the phases the past year. You did not and for that reason, the others are not pleased and wish to terminate you. I have convinced them to delay that. We can still acquire valuable information from you. Be warned though, I cannot hold off your termination indefinitely, and the Council is more resourceful than the Factory. The Life Closers we sent after you were merely tests. They were not a means to destroy you. Increase your skills so when the time comes you may bar your termination."

I pause from reading. According to this member, that woman hasn't reached the Gamma and Delta Phases, whatever they might be. My mom was concerned that Pandora may have reached them and brought about some sort of disaster.

I continue reading, "Argus, the poor devil, informed us in the past that you have no memory of who you are and that is most unfortunate, so I will tell you one thing. The Council did not begin your training or condition you. It was another department in the Sphinx Corporation. I wish I could tell you everything but..." The line breaks off, and a new line starts. "Remember if you wish to destroy the Rogue, you must reach the Delta Phase; it is called the Knowing and to achieve the Knowing, you must first reach the Gamma Phase. I wish you long life."

The letter's signed by Mr. Morta, and I glance over it once more, then place the letter back in its envelope, and put it in that woman's backpack. The corporation my father works for is behind the Pandora Project, so there could be a connection between my mom and that woman. I also need to find out what the Gamma and the Delta Phases are. Mr. Morta called one of them the Knowing. I can't even fathom what she's supposed to know, so I search the room once more and head back up.

Sometime later...

The elevator doors open to an Un-Man, and I quickly raise my gun, not expecting to be met by one of those robots.

It's the one called the Rogue, and it lifts its hands as it tells me, "Do not shoot."

"You again," I state a bit freaked out that it might have followed me here. I keep my gun leveled on it and ask, "What do you want now?"

"I was snooping around this place myself when I saw you enter, and I hid and then thought to myself, you might be able to help me." The Rogue keeps its hands up. "I know you came back and saved Pandora." It pauses and continues, "That act alone confused me, and I have been trying to process it since but have not been able to."

It never answered my question, so I snap, "What do you want?"

"I am rambling, so I will get to the point then. I have a proposition." The Rogue pauses again and then asks, "Can I lower my hands?"

I have no idea what it wants from me, but it does seem to be everywhere, it must know a lot of things, so I should at least hear it out. I nod and wave the Rogue back with my gun as I step from the elevator, and then I question, "A proposition?"

"Yes, I overheard you talking with the doctor at the hospital," the Rogue tells me as it lowers its hands. "You told him you were looking for who killed Theresa Griffin."

Anger and rage wash over me at the mention of my mom's death. I want to know who killed her, and I'll do anything to find out even make a deal with this tin can.

"Do you know who murdered her?"

"No, I do not have that information, but I did find something at the Factory. I discovered a disk I believe belonged to your mother."

I ask, "And you want what in exchange?"

"Silly woman, I want Pandora of course. Bring her to the Factory so I may kill her. Here..." The Rogue hands me a piece of paper and a small blueprint labeled BL5. "This is the location of the Factory along with the layout for Basement Level Five of Research Building 10." It hands me a white keycard. "This will get you in through the parking garage." I take it, and the Rogue continues, "Bring Pandora tomorrow night after nine to the first room circled on the blueprint in the Green Division, and I will have the disk waiting for you in the Computer Lab circled in the Yellow Division. Here..." The Rogue hands me one green and one yellow keycard. "Those will get you in the rooms, and one word of warning, the T-3s have gone rogue and have taken over the Factory. You will have to elude them." The Rogue hands me a small piece of paper. "Once you have the disk, that word will unlock it."

I glance at the password and snarl at the Rogue, wondering if it's trying to tell me something with this access word.

"How do you know I'll turn her over?" I question it.

"Because I know your kind. You do not care about anyone even dear old dad. The only person you ever loved was murdered, and you want to find her killer and take your revenge." The Rogue starts out. "You must be looking for a way to get rid of the headache you reluctantly took in. There is no easier way than to hand Pandora over to me, and you get something out of the deal."

"Fine, tomorrow then," I state and watch the Rogue leave.

It's right about one thing, that woman has been nothing but a nuisance. I'll have to say sorry to my mom's memory. It was so long ago that she wanted me to save that woman and so much has changed. I glance at my gun and stare at my hand tinged with unseen blood. Much has changed, including me.
Chapter Thirty-five

The Locked Door

2:47 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Nexus Apartments...

The digital clock in the kitchen read 2:47 P.M. as Kat slightly stirred on the couch, and Unfinished Melody played, keeping her in the grips of the Drifting Time. The digital clock was the only light in the dark apartment.

"Door unlocked," A.C.S. stated.

The spare bedroom unlocked, and the light within flicked on, lighting up the crack under the closed door.

Katharine's view...

I open my eyes at hearing a sound, sit up a little disoriented, then close the music box, and place it in my pocket.

"Umm... Could I have some lights?"

"Guest request acknowledged." A.C.S. turns on the ones in the living room. "Setting lights to ninety-five percent."

I scan the apartment but see no one. I thought I had heard someone talk.

"Umm... Apartment Computer System, did you say something earlier?"

"Yes, I stated that the spare bedroom has been unlocked and the room is ready for use."

"Oh..." I stand, rub my eyes, walk to the first room in the hall, and open the door. "Kimberly, are you back?"

No one's in the room, so I enter and look around curious as to why it had been locked in the first place. The walls are full of photos of Kimberly as a child and her mom, and a few of them have a man in them who I guess is her father. Kimberly was a really cute kid. I walk by a bed that hasn't been used in years, go and stand in front of a wall, and take a closer look at the little blonde girl in the pictures.

I can't believe this is the same person I met. Kimberly was so happy back then. I see pictures of her eating ice cream, petting kittens, and playing on a sunny beach. I can't even imagine what has happened to her since to make her so unhappy and angry. I rub my shoulder as it itches a little, and then I decide I shouldn't be in here. Kimberly would be mad, so I leave the room.

I head toward the living room and then glance back at the bedroom. Kimberly locked all of those happy memories away. It's like she hid them in there so she didn't have to remember. Maybe it was too painful for her.

I start for the couch. A.C.S. unlocked the room, but Kimberly wasn't here to give the command. Maybe A.C.S. is malfunctioning. I yawn, groggy from sleeping, then return to the couch, and plop down on the cold leather. I can't believe how tired I am as I lie back, remove the music box, and stare at it. I don't know what I would do without it. I hold the music box close to my chest, thinking what a luxury it is to sleep without fear the Un-Men will find me. I grab my blanket and pull it over me. I'm warm and safe, what more could a girl ask for? I drift asleep without the music box to lull me.

End Katharine's view...

Outside of Nexus Apartments...

A white van parked at the curb in front of the gate facing Knot Street sputtered smoke from its muffler. The engine idled as Zax sat in the driver's seat, typing a few things on his H.H.C. and once he finished, he placed the H.H.C. on the passenger seat.

Zax's view...

I don't understand why R.G. had me do it, but I guess my job isn't to know the why only to do what I'm told. I remove a cell from my shirt pocket, dial a number, and say, "Delivery Man here, please connect me to R.G." A few seconds pass, and I state, "Yes, as per your instructions I waited till Ms. Griffin left the apartment, and I triggered the A.C.S. to unlock the spare bedroom so the rest is up to Katharine. Yes. Yes. I'm monitoring the situation now." I see a red car drive by. "Kimberly is returning." I buckle my seat belt. "I'll contact you with any new development, Delivery Man out."

I hang up and drive a little way down Knot Street and turn onto West 1000 Avenue to get in a better position. Kimberly won't be too happy to discover the spare bedroom has been opened. Poor Katharine... Kimberly might kill her if she went into her mother's room.

End Zax's view...

Sometime later...

Kimberly's view...

The door to Apartment H slides open, and I enter a little fatigued. I don't know why I feel so weary unless it's the decision to betray that woman that weighs on me. It shouldn't bother me, and I convince myself that I'm only tired from the mess that woman put me through.

"Welcome back Ms..."

"Night and Quiet Mode, A.C.S."

It shuts down its verbal interaction and reverts to its evening settings as I walk down the entry to the kitchen, and the lights come on at fifty percent. I set her backpack on a barstool, place her Beretta on the counter, and turn to the living room. I move to the back of the couch and find that woman asleep, clinging to the music box like it's a teddy bear. I stare at the enigma as she sleeps soundly. I could so easily kill her. I could walk around this couch and snap her neck, and nobody would ever know. No one will care that that woman's gone except maybe the Council, and they will only care because she's some precious experiment of theirs. I put my hand on my hip in a tisk-tisk fashion. That woman should have heard me when I entered and woke up. Her instinct to survive must not be very strong.

I think about what I'm going to do to her when I deliver her to the Factory, and I take pity on her. I haven't pitied anyone in a long time. A babe I took off the streets... an innocent I'll deliver to her demise. I snatched her from the fangs of the grave only to hand her over to the Reaper.

I consider the conversation that I had at Etna. The Rogue couldn't be right about her. Her trust in me must be an act. It has to be an act... She couldn't have survived this long as a kitten. She has to be a tigress.

My pity turns to anger as I think about the trust she has in me. Stupid... It's her fault if I betray her. I never told her to trust me. I'm a Closer. I only look out for myself.

I return to the kitchen, place my car keys on the counter, and lean on the counter as guilt burdens me. My mom told me to save her but finding out who murdered my mom is more important to me than saving that woman.

I hear her mumble and move back to the couch. She sleeps, but her lips move, reciting a phrase in a murmur. I place a hand on the back of the couch and lean over to listen.

"Always know there will be a love that will not die."

I walk around the sofa, not sure of what she said. She rolls over, faces the couch, and says nothing more. I shrug and start for the hallway as I decide as if I haven't done so a dozen times over that whatever she's the key to doesn't matter to me. It's more important that I discover who murdered my mom and take my revenge. I pause at the hallway entrance and glance back at the living room. That woman has been nothing but a headache since our meeting. I'll be glad to be rid of her. I walk past the spare bedroom, wondering how I'll convince her to come to the Factory with me. From what she has told me, if I was her, I wouldn't want to return there.

Exhausted from all the running around, I reach for the doorknob of the master bedroom, thinking those problems can wait until morning. My eyes droop. I need to get some sleep. I pause as my heart skips a beat and my weary mind recalls something out of place, and I quickly turn, looking to the spare bedroom. A glow shows through the crack under the door, and I walk back and turn the knob, expecting it to be locked, but the door opens. Furious, I search the room and find nothing has been moved. Everything is as I left it years ago.

I'm going to kill her. I'm not going to wait for the Rogue to do it. I'm going to kill her right now! I march into the living room as I fist my hand, controlling my anger, and then I say in a forced gentle tone, "A.C.S."

"Yes, Ms. Griffin."

"How did she unlock this door?"

"She?"

"Yes, Pandora... I mean Katharine."

"Your guest did not unlock the door. A command was given over the Nexus Apartment's main system."

"By who?"

"Identity unknown," A.C.S. replies.

I take several deep breaths as my anger boils again. "Tell me this, did she go in the room?"

"Yes, your guest entered after I announced the door had been unlocked."

I fist my other hand, thinking of beating her to death while she's sleeping, but then I wouldn't get what I want from the Rogue. I have to be very careful what I do next. I don't want to jeopardize the prize I'm seeking, so I decide I can't yell at her, not if I want that woman to go to the Factory with me tomorrow. I'll have to let this go for now. The Rogue can torture her for violating my privacy.

"A.C.S., lock this bedroom door."

"Yes, Ms. Griffin."

I head into my bedroom as exhaustion seizes me again, shut the door, and slip into my pajamas. I lie on my stomach and clinch my pillow with both hands. I can't get the idea of that woman rummaging through all my precious stuff. She better not of touched anything or the Rogue will be the least of her worries.

End Kimberly's view...

Back in the living room...

Kat's face wrinkled as her dream changed to a nightmare, and she uttered, "Preacher! No! Don't die. You can't leave me alone. Don't leave us alone." Her eyes rapidly moved under her closed lids. "What do I tell him? What do I tell Chad? NO!"

Katharine's view...

I sit up and look around as sweat beads my forehead, and I sadden as grief strikes me. I have no idea what I'll tell the boy. First, I left and now Preacher left him. I cover myself with the blanket. I know it's not safe, but I need to find Chad and tell him what happened.

Back in the master bedroom...

Kimberly's view...

I continue to stare at my pillow, repeating to myself that woman's life means nothing to me. I keep thinking back to what the hologram told me, and I'm hesitant to hand her over to the Rogue for the disk. I roll on my side and grumble. Hades! Nothing's been easy since I met her. It'll be good to get rid of her, and it'll be good to return to my mundane life. I chuckle. Listen to me, I never thought I'd hear myself say I miss the solitude. I roll on my back, contemplating if I really do miss the loneliness.
Chapter Thirty-six

What's On TV?

October 20...

Wednesday...

7:58 A.M...

Kimberly's view...

The TV comes to life as I turn it on with the remote, and Anchorman Jim Charles with NBS gives a report.

"As we wrap up this hour, news has come in that Dr. Robert Seeker's trip to Antarctica has been delayed."

I only turned the TV on for noise and don't really pay any attention to it. The one I've reluctantly partnered with sits at the kitchen bar and watches me cook oatmeal and fry eggs and bacon as if she's famished. She slept for more than twelve hours so she better be well rested. Her stomach growls as I pour her a glass of orange juice.

The anchorman continues, "Dr. Seeker was scheduled to leave yesterday but–"

She hums Unfinished Melody as she whirls around on the bar stool like some kid on a merry-go-round.

I comment, "You're in a better mood this morning."

"I am," that woman says.

"–the helicopter had mechanical problems," Jim Charles continues. "Dr. Seeker should be on his way to Vulcan Station within the next twenty-four hours." The anchorman turns to another camera. "This just came in... There are reports of several explosions in the Hellenistic Sector."

I'm still unconcerned with the news as I place a plate full of scrambled eggs and bacon in front of that woman along with a bowl of oatmeal and say, "There's milk and honey if you want it."

I move over to the side of the kitchen to grab a glass when I turn and see that woman staring at the TV. The flames from the explosions reflect in her eyes, and she's fixated by the destruction. Her stomach growls again as if it's some stray dog warning her of danger. She turns, facing the counter, dives into the eggs, shoveling them into her mouth, and devours strips of bacon between spoonfuls.

I'm appalled by her tiger-like eating and utter, "I guess you were never taught manners."

She peers up from her plate wide-eyed, picks up a napkin, and wipes her mouth, and then she continues eating at a slower pace. "Sorry... I was just so hungry."

The anchorman finishes, "At this point, the cause of the explosions is unknown. We will update you as new reports come in. This is Jim Charles with NBS, signing off."

I walk over to my plate and take several bites of my breakfast.

Katharine's view...

"Umm... Last night..." I begin as I'm unsure if I should even mention it to the angry Phoenix. "A.C.S. woke me, and your spare bedroom light was on, so I went in."

I wait to see if she'll pull out her gun and shoot me in the knee or grab my hair and bash my head on the table. I tense, not knowing what sort of fury will be coming.

Kimberly's view...

I stop eating, put my fork down, and fixate on my plate. That woman better not have touched anything, not one item in that room or so help me... I pick up the remote and turn off the news.

Katharine's view...

I notice the change in Kimberly's demeanor, and I cautiously continue, "I ah... thought you were home and went in. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. It's a special place. One you made for your mom. I shouldn't have–"

"Did you..?" Kimberly interrupts me as she raises her scary gaze and glares at me. "Did you touch anything?"

"Umm..." I swallow hard, feeling the intensity of her stare. "No, I only touched the doorknob."

Kimberly's view...

I pick up my fork and examine it as if I'll stab it through that woman's heart, but I have to remember the Factory and the disk. I can't make the deal with the Rogue if that woman's already dead, so I calm down and force a smile. I can kill that woman at any time if I don't want the disk anymore. I set the fork down and lie, "It's fine." I press a wider toothy smile and coo out, "No harm done."

Katharine's view...

Kimberly's smile makes me uneasy as the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, and I dare not say anymore.

Kimberly's view...

Merely setting the fork down isn't enough to quell my wrath, so I have to think of something else and take my mind away from the image of that woman violating the memories in the room. I remember Etna Toys and the things I found there.

"Oh..." I say as I stand, retrieve that woman's backpack, pull out the envelope, and hand her the letter from Mr. Morta. "I found this yesterday in the basement of Etna Toys."

She acts like she's a bit afraid of me as she takes the letter. I must have scared her. Good... that woman should be afraid of me. She opens the letter and after about a minute, that woman says, "I wonder what Mr. Morta meant by 'the poor devil' when he referred to Argus."

I don't care, so I don't say anything. She reads over the letter one more time as I start to go over in my head how to manipulate things so that woman will go to the Factory with me.

"If I understand everything–" I start out. "–you want to find out who you are and what you've forgotten."

"Yes, and you're searching for who killed your mom," she replies as if we're in sync on some weird level of communication.

"Here's the deal," I begin. "We'll work together to find our answers but once I find my mom's killer, this partnership is done. Understand? I'll help you no more after that. I have no reason to."

Katharine's view...

It's a little one-sided, but it's not like I have a better offer, so I nod.

"Good then." Kimberly retrieves her knapsack from her bedroom, returns, and removes some papers. "I need your help. I have discovered the location of the Factory. There's vital information about my mom there and the information's on a disk." She shows me the address. "I'm heading there tonight. Will you come with me?"

I can't believe it. Kimberly wants me to go to the Factory! She wants me to go back after they tortured me. I don't know if I can. I swore I would never let them take me again, so there's no way I'm going back. I glance at Kimberly and notice how much it means to her that we find this disk she mentioned. I'm partners with her, and we're supposed to help each other. I push my fears aside and ask, "Is this information important?"

"I believe it is very important. Will you help me?" Kimberly adds as if baiting me, "The Factory could have information on you."

She's right about that. The Factory could have some, but I don't know if it'll be worth the risk. I did tell Kimberly I'd help but going back... I'm so afraid, but I can't be a wimp. If Kimberly has a plan and we can sneak in, we may have a chance. Even if Kimberly has a plan, that doesn't mean we won't get caught. It's so hard for me to decide, but then I think about what I would do if Kimberly was one of my friends... if she was Chad and he was asking for my help. I wouldn't hesitate to tell him yes.

"If it's important, I'll do it," I finally answer as I start on my oatmeal and say between mouthfuls, "That's what partners do. They help each other, but you do have a plan, right? I don't want to get caught again."

"I have a plan, so don't you worry. Someone on the inside's helping me."

I say, "I always worry but that doesn't matter."

Kimberly's view...

"It's settled then... We'll go later tonight," I tell her, realizing it wasn't hard convincing that woman. "I've acquired an untraceable van for the job. Eat up and rest. I need to pick up some more supplies."

She looks at my half-eaten plate, licking salt and grease from her lips, and then that woman asks, "Are you going to finish that?"

A little disgusted, I answer, "No, go ahead."

She pulls my plate in front of her and chows down on the eggs as I clean up the kitchen. What a disgusting thing she is? I only have to put up with her until tonight. I think I can survive her presence until then. There's something I want, something I need. I finish cleaning and head out.

Katharine's view...

A few minutes later, I put the plates in the sink and grab the remote. I go and move the blanket and pillow to the side of the couch and sit. I put the remote on the coffee table and massage my left shoulder around the bandages. The wound's feeling much better, but I better check on the burn. I unwrap the gauze from my left hand and examine the palm, seeing the blisters and most of the redness are gone but the star remains. I rub my fingers across the hand. I thought I had burned the higher part of my palm, but the star's dead center. It must've been my imagination. A lot was going on that day. I make a fist several times; it's almost as good as new. The ointment works fast. I pick up the remote and turn on the TV. I change the channel from the news to a show called Cash In! just as it's wrapping up with some final words from its host, Sam Hunt.

"Alright viewers, if you have seen any of these people call the number you see on the screen to..."

The TV audience shouts with him, "Cash In!"

"That's right!" Sam Hunt yells. "Don't let the bounty hunters make all the money. Your call could bring you a percentage of the reward so keep those peepers open." He points at the camera. "Until tomorrow..."

The TV audience shouts the show's slogan with Sam Hunt, "If your friend, family, or neighbor is wanted by the N.C.P.F. or a Corporation, you could Cash In!"

The credits roll, and I change the channel back to the news.

"I'm Linda Harvey with NBS. Welcome to our late morning edition." The anchorwoman turns to a different camera. "The top three stories headlining in the news will start our show. Several Giant Swallowtail Butterflies were discovered in Noir Transgenic National Forest yesterday. The butterflies were thought to be extinct along with most of the Dark Half's life forms." She pauses. "The Corporate Senate meets today to vote on the quarter-cent sales tax raise, and the three people believed behind the scam The Dead Receiving Water Rations were given a court date." Linda turns to a second camera. "The Giant Swallowtail Butterflies thought to be extinct were discovered in Noir Transgenic National Forest yesterday. Experts believe the insects were able to survive in the sunless forest by changing their food which also became extinct after the Dry Clouds appeared but at this point, it is unknown what food source they have switched to. A group of scientists is on their way to the National Forest to begin their study of this resilient species." Linda pauses again. "The Corporate Senate meets today to vote on the quarter-cent sales tax raise. Many analysts believe..." She puts a hand to her earpiece and nods. "This just came in. We now know who is behind the earlier explosions in the Hellenistic Sector. It seems that hundreds of bio-mechas are terrorizing the area and at this time, it is unclear which corporation is responsible for these robotic men. It is also unknown if they are deliberate attacks or malfunctions. The Corporate Senate is looking into the matter. We go now to one of our reporters in the field."

A man with a mic stands in the middle of a street with several huge buildings in the background. Flames spit from the windows of a tall structure, and people can be heard screaming along with bursts of gunfire.

"Frank Trepit here." The reporter glances behind himself. "Reports are coming in from all over the Hellenistic Sector of robotic men attacking Sphinx Corporation facilities." Gunfire erupts, and the reporter ducks and runs along with the cameraman to the cover of a building. Frank speaks out of breath, "The N.C.P.F. are on the scene but have not been able to stop these... Wait! There's one now!"

The camera pans to a T-3 as it marches down the street, shooting at everything that moves. I clench my wrist as if I'm wrenching the T-3's arm. The camera goes in for a close-up. I glare at the T-3's pale features. It and the other models of Un-Men have haunted my dreams. I lift the remote, turn the TV off, and stare at the blank screen. I remove the music box from my pants' pocket and open it to hear it soothing tune. If the T-3s have malfunctioned, the Factory has to be on high alert, and it won't be easy getting in or out. We also might encounter the T-3s while we're there. I stare at the coffee table, and my eyes droop as I listen to Unfinished Melody. The T-3s are different now. I can tell. I grab the blanket and wrap it around myself and start to fall asleep. The T-3s are cruel and calculating. They're just like the Rogue.
Chapter Thirty-seven

Entering The Factory

5:49 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office...

Mr. Griffin studied reports on his desktop computer when the phone rang, interrupting his work. He picked up the receiver and answered, "Yes, Cathy."

"Mr. Griffin, your 6:00 appointment is here, and Orthos is on line two."

"My head of security must have an update for me." Mr. Griffin leaned forward, put his earpiece in, and spoke into the phone receiver, "Thank you, Cathy. Please tell my appointment I will be delayed while I talk with Orthos."

"Yes, Mr. Griffin." She hung up.

He placed the receiver back on the phone, activated the earpiece, pressed line two, and stood. He walked from his corner desk to one of the large wall windows and stared at his reflection. "Orthos, go ahead."

"I have news from my men watching the Factory."

Mr. Griffin questioned, "What is it?"

"A van has been reported approaching the main gate."

"My orders were to let no one in or out. I don't see why you brought this to my attention."

"Your daughter is driving the van. I wanted to check with you before we–"

"One moment," Mr. Griffin interrupted, moved away from the window, and wondered why Kim was going to the Factory and how did she know of its location. Someone must have given her the information. He just needed to discover why she was there.

He asked, "Is she alone?"

"No, the Pandora Project is with her," Orthos answered.

His daughter still had the stray with her. He looked at the picture of his wife as he considered if it was worth his daughter's life to let them proceed. Whatever she was after could be very valuable, so he instructed, "Let them through, and I don't want them to know your men are there."

"Understood." Orthos hung up.

Mr. Griffin removed the earpiece and walked back to the window. "Lights dim."

The office darkened, his reflection vanished, and he saw outside to Noir's skyline. The Dry Clouds were so close he could touch them, but his daughter eluded him. With his office almost halfway up the mile-high building, Mr. Griffin had an excellent view of the city and could easily see a hovertrain station six blocks away.

He thought about his only child. Kim wanted something so badly at the Factory that she would go up against the Un-Men.

* * *

Minutes earlier...

5:41 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

Kimberly's view...

I drive the gray van and near one of the Hellenistic Sector's boundaries on a desolate highway and from the dark road, I see a lit facility in the distance. I turn the vehicle in that direction and stop the van at the Factory's main entrance.

"Look, they left the front door open for us." I motion to the mangled gate and smart-off, "It's an invitation if I've ever seen one."

"It looks like the T-3s have attacked their own creators," that woman tells me.

"Or a rival corporation is staging a hostile takeover," I state. "Can you tell if the T-3s are the ones responsible?"

Katharine's view...

I'm a little distracted as I glance across the dark fields filled with tall weeds that surround the front fence and along the side road. The hunts over the past year have developed instincts within me, I don't think anyone could have foreseen by my conditioning. I'm still not sure what this conditioning is that has been referred to by those who work for the Council. I only know they have great expectations for it and my development as a weapon. I will defy them... I'm more than a weapon. No, I'm a person, not a weapon.

I tell Kimberly, "We're being watched."

She parts her zipped up sweatshirt and goes for the PPK in her shoulder holster. "The T-3s?"

I hear the panic in her voice even though Kimberly tries to hide it. I remain calm, hoping it'll rub off on her as I reply, "No, just men. They're most likely S.C.Ms. There are several of them hiding in the field." I make no movement for the Beretta resting on my lap. "I believe they're here to contain the T-3s."

"I don't know if that's good or bad for us." Kimberly glances out her window and searches the field. "I don't see anyone. Whoever they are, they're good." She turns to me and says, "I bet you were no fun at hide-and-seek."

I consider her remark and say, "I don't know." The more I think about it the sadder I get. "I don't know if I ever played games."

Kimberly's view...

I look in the distance to the Factory's dozen or so buildings. I know what I'm getting myself into but if I want a certain item, I'll need to breach a few levels of Hades. "If the S.C.Ms. were going to stop us, they would have done so by now." I step on the gas, and the vehicle speeds down the long stretch of paved road and after some time, I slow the van, turn a corner, and drive past a graveyard of smoldering cars and trucks littered with blackened skeletal remains. "Looks like they had a bang of a party."

That woman makes a particular peculiar face. I had asked her about it before. She says, if I'm to believe her, that her body reacts to the presence of bio-mechas and gives her a warning right before her body prepares to face them. I don't know... She's sounding weirder by the word. Who is Pandora really? I guess I don't have to worry about that anymore.

"There are several T-3s near," that woman tells me as she turns, looking out the van's back windows. "I sense they're behind us, but I don't see them yet."

"Let's not wait around." I drive on and pull into the parking garage for Research Building 10. "This is the building we're looking for." I drive down a ramp to Basement Level One. "Can you tell if the T-3s know you're here?"

"I can only sense them from this distance. I don't know what they're thinking, not unless I'm really close to them."

"You're not all-seeing then," I say as I turn off the ignition. I guess she's not as weird as she could be. "Let's get inside. I don't like being out in the open, not with those walking appliances around." I hop out of the van, rush to the rear, and open the van's back doors. "Here's your stuff." I hand that woman her backpack and the Ravlek Vest.

Katharine's view...

I put on the vest, velcroing the sides. The armor has saved me countless times before, and I wish I had one for Kimberly. Should I offer the vest to her? I'm afraid of losing my own life too much to do such a kind gesture, so I never offer.

"Ready?" Kimberly asks.

I nod.

"Great. Let's go."

Together we hurry to a staircase and descend four floors to Basement Level Five. Kimberly has her gun at the ready as do I. She uses the Research Building 10 keycard to unlock the staircase entrance and turns the knob. The door opens with a squeak. She cautiously steps through to the first area that's designated the Blue Division, and the floor's deathly quiet as we scan the hall.

"Are we clear?"

"Give me a second." I close my eyes and use my ability, and it stretches across the level, probing the area, and then I open my eyes. "I don't sense any active Un-Men."

Kimberly's view...

"Come on then." I remove the blueprint as I hurry on, noting the two rooms the Rogue circled. I tell that woman, "There are two possible places the disk could be." I rush through a carpeted hall and then another as that woman follows. I set up my plan along with that woman as I say, "We'll split up to save time."

Katharine's view...

A putrid odor hits us, stopping me in my tracks, and I cover my nose with my t-shirt. "That smell..." I look at Kimberly who's not bothered by the horrible stench.

Her tone and attitude don't change. "You should have expected this. We knew the T-3s attacked the Factory. It probably happened days ago. You should be used to this smell by now."

"How can you say that? No one should ever get used to this stench."

Kimberly's view...

I ignore her comment, continue around the corner, head past a security desk, and enter the Green Division. I can tell that woman's appalled by my callousness as she follows me. What I'm surprised by is that she's not like me. To think someone like her is worried about strangers.

A few dead S.C.Ms. lie in pools of congealed blood along with more than a dozen bullet-riddled techs and with my mind on the disk, I continue the conversation as if I never came across any dead bodies.

"You'll go to Research Lab Five that is located in this division, and I'll go to Computer Lab Two located in the Yellow Division." I show that woman the blueprint as I hurriedly walk through the hallway. "Once you're done, meet me here." I point to a security desk on the blueprint that's located at a checkpoint in between the Green and Yellow Divisions. I'll never be going there, and I doubt that woman will ever make it out of Research Lab Five.

Katharine's view...

I can't believe Kimberly's this cold. I put a hand on my stomach, feeling sick after seeing all those dead people. I notice they don't bother her at all. Doesn't Kimberly care about anything? I remember the spare room at the apartment. Kimberly did care about her mom, but what about now? Isn't there anyone? What about her father? I feel sorry for her. She seems...

Kimberly's view...

"Do you understand where we are to meet?" I ask and notice that woman has been staring at me instead of the blueprint. What's she looking at? She does seem bothered by something. I repeat, "Do you understand?"

Katharine's view...

She seems... Kimberly seems lonely.

I peer at the blueprint where Kimberly points, and I nod.

Kimberly's view...

"Great, let's do this," I say as I fold the paper and place it in my knapsack.

Why is she looking at me that way? It's giving me the creeps.

Katharine's view...

I notice her irritation and turn my focus to the hall where more bodies litter the area. I look at the terror-stricken faces of the Factory's employees as a deep feeling of pity rips at my gut. I don't look at Kimberly, but I know she regards the people as debris in her way. Is this who Kimberly is? Is she really uncaring and callous? Is she the kind of person that death's no more than a byproduct of her job?
Chapter Thirty-eight

Help Us

6:47 P.M...

Katharine's view...

I lag behind Kimberly a little as we rush through the halls of the Green Division, and we continue running as I lose count of the dead. I stop when something catches my eye and then hurry back to a door that had been knocked in. The room's B10-148 and inside, three men are strapped to the examining tables in their upright position.

I rush in as I utter, "Argus?" I move to his side, finding he has been badly beaten and has a bullet wound in his left leg.

He looks at me with his good eye. His other one's too swollen to open. His throat's dry as he rasps, "Kat..? How did you–"

"Shh..." I say, worried about his injuries. "Don't talk." I start on his straps.

"For Ares' sake!" Kimberly utters as she rushes in. "What are you doing?" She notices the men. "Hades! We don't have time for this."

"Then help me!" I snap and motion to the two men. "Release the techs."

"Yeah, release us!" the two men plead.

"We don't have time for this," Kimberly repeats and then when she notices I'm not listening to her, she goes ahead and helps the techs.

Once she releases the two men's hand restraints, the two men start to undo their own leg restraints.

"What happened here?" Kimberly asks them as I help Argus to his feet.

"The T-3s went rogue," the skinny tech replies as he gets off the table and goes to assist his partner with a leg strap he can't undo.

"They killed everyone here except us," the heavyset tech says as he stands to the floor. "I was sure they would come back and torture us like they did that man." He motions to Argus and mumbles, "They still might."

Argus asks, "Who's behind the attacks?" His face contorts with pain as he leans against the table, removes his belt, and tightly buckles it around his left leg to slow down the bleeding. He grunts with the effort.

Kimberly demands, "Before anyone else says anything, tell me who you all are."

"This is Argus," I tell her.

"I'm Maxwell and this is Peters and as for the other question, no one's behind the attacks."

"What my partner means is that the T-3s are behind the attacks." Peters rubs his bruised wrists. "And we don't know why."

The techs look at us as if we're some nightmarish fiends, and then Maxwell asks, "Who sent you? The Sphinx Corporation?"

Kimberly shakes her head.

Maybe the techs are afraid that their rescuers might end up being the grim reaper. I want to put their minds at ease but I don't know what to say. Both techs look at one another and take a step back.

"Are you here to save us?" Maxwell questions as he feels around the table behind him, searching for a weapon.

"Yes," I answer before Kimberly can.

That's all they need to hear, and the techs relax.

Peters questions, "How can we repay you?"

I ask, "Do you have a vehicle?"

"Yes." Maxwell points his thumb over his shoulder. "As long as the T-3s haven't set it on fire."

"Then take this man to a hospital." I face Argus and gently stroke his injured cheek; it's the same cheek I had struck days earlier. "And we'll call it even." All the grief and anger over his involvement in Preacher's death fades as I see him hurt.

"Kat... I..." Argus' voice cracks as he looks deep into my eyes. He knows I care for him, not like Preacher but in a way... It's hard to explain how I feel about him. Argus turns away from my gaze as if he's ashamed of something. "I..."

"It's okay," I whisper. "My thanks for rescuing me when I was in the hands of the Factory so think of us as even." I take a step back so the techs can move in and grab him. "Now please, go with these men."

He nods.

I look at the techs and ask, "What are your names again?"

"I'm Peters and this is Maxwell."

"I'll try to remember. I'm bad with names, now please hurry. Argus needs to get to the hospital."

Maxwell grabs Argus under his arm and starts out the door as Peters leads. The three men hurry through the hallway toward Research Building 10's front entrance. I think it'll take them some time to get there.

"Can we continue our mission now?" Kimberly questions me as she puts a hand on her hip. "Or are there some lab rats you want to rescue? Are there some rabbits you want to set free?"

"Oh, I almost forgot," I exclaim as I run out into the hallway and shout after the techs, "Wait!" I rush to the men. "Take this." I hand Peters my Beretta and magazines. "Do you know how to use one?"

He glances at the gun and takes it. "Yes, and thanks."

I start to say, "To terminate an Un-Man, you have to–"

"Hit the automaton's brain between its eyes," Peters interrupts me. "Yes, I know. It was me and Maxwell that decided the Un-Men's vulnerability. They're still hard to kill but not indestructible in case something like this happened."

The three men hasten their steps.

I watch till they're out of sight, turn to rush down the hallway, and almost run into the scowling Kimberly.

Kimberly's view...

"You didn't give that man your only gun, did you?"

"Maybe..." she answers me like a child who isn't sure if she's in trouble or not. "They might run into a T-3. They'll need it."

"And you don't think you will?"

She shrugs as she tells me, "I plan on avoiding the T-3s, and you destroyed my tracking beacon, so they don't know I'm here. Hopefully, I won't run into any."

I'm feeling a bit responsible for what's about to happen to her. I blink twice as I feel like I've been caught in a lie, but that woman doesn't know I betrayed her stupid trust. I frown at my own thoughts. I can't be feeling guilty. It's not like me. She's the idiot who gave her gun away and if she dies, it's her own fault.

I tell her, "Come on, let's get this over with." We hurry through the corridor as I question, "Was that blond guy a friend of yours? I mean the two of you acted–"

"No," she interrupts me. She sounds like she's not sure how she feels about him. "He's my shadow. He's my constant phantom in the darkness."

"O-kay..." I utter.

Even her friends are freaks.

We run through several more halls, and I stop and say, "Here's your room." I slide the green keycard down a reader, unlock the door, and hand the card to that woman. "Be careful, the T-3s might not know you're here but that doesn't mean you're safe."

"I know." She takes the card, starts in, and pauses. "Good luck. I hope one of us finds the disk."

"Thanks. Ah... See you later."

I rush across the hall, feeling like my whole body's made of lead, and it's dragging me down. I can't be feeling guilty. Closers don't experience guilt. I pause in my tracks. The Rogue did want a fight, and it's only fair that I give it what it wants, so I hurry back to the Research Lab and yell, "Katharine!"

That woman returns to the door. "Yes?" Hopeful, she asks me, "Did you find something?"

"No, I only wanted to..." I hand her a PPK and some magazines. "Here, take my backup."

"Thanks." She takes the gun and starts back in as she tells me, "Stay safe."

"Sure, you too."

I continue through the hall. There, I can say I did help her, and now my mind can rest at ease, not that I ever felt a smidgen of guilt. That strange woman means nothing to me and discovering who murdered my mom is more important than any stupid project's life.
Chapter Thirty-nine

The Two Rooms

7:10 P.M...

Katharine's view...

I enter Research Lab Five and find the room abandoned. Cobwebs and dust abound, and a musty smell lingers. I set my backpack on a chair, stare at the gutted computer workstations, and move on to three rectangular tables. They contain racks filled with test tubes labeled with numeric codes, beakers containing liquid in a rainbow of hues, and about a dozen binocular microscopes. A poster of the periodic table containing 126 elements hangs on the wall. I count the different colored squares. I thought there was only supposed to be 118 elements. I search through drawers and cabinets, under tables and chairs, and every crack and crevasse that could possibly hide a disk. I search twice but find nothing. I see a door in the back of the room, walk to it, and pause, wondering if I should enter. I glance above the door to a nameplate "The Gallery". I wiggle the locked knob and notice the door has no keycard access; it only has a hand scanner. I could go back and drag one of the employees in here, but I don't think I want to touch any dead bodies. I look at my right palm. I could try my hand. I'm part of the Sphinx Corporation. It could work or I could set off an alarm, and then the T-3s will know I'm here. Maybe I'll ask Kimberly or I'll just take the chance. The T-3s might not know why an alarm's going off. I shrug, place my hand on the device, and hold my breath, not knowing what will happen. I wince and lean back slightly as if the scanner will explode.

The reader buzzes as a horizontal bar of white light scans my palm, and the reader states in a male robotic voice, "Handprint not on record." It scans my palm a second time with a vertical bar of blue light and states, "No cipher detected. Access denied."

I straighten my stance. It didn't let me in, but it also didn't sound an alarm. I step back from the door. It did mention a cipher. Doesn't that mean zero or code? I stare at the star on my left palm. Or maybe a mark? I place that hand on the reader, and the device activates again, scanning first with the horizontal bar of white light.

"Handprint not on record," it states and scans my palm a second time with the vertical bar of blue light. "Cipher detected. Activating micro-reader." A diagonal bar of white light scans my palm. "Access granted."

The door unlocks, and I turn the knob and enter a larger room lit only by accent lights. I leave the door open in case Kimberly comes in looking for me, pause just inside the entrance, and search the area. The room smells old, not musty like the other one but old like a museum. No computers or lab equipment are inside only several life-size white marble statues, and they're all of the same bearded man in different poses. He's wearing a robe and holding various objects, and all of the statues point to a wall in the back. I walk to the wall, and it looks like the others in the room; it's tiled with light brown marble. I start to put my hand on the wall when I feel heat and something vibrating against my leg. I reach into my thigh pocket, pull out the music box, and find a blue square on each end glowing through the metal. I've never seen them before. I touch them at the same time, and the hologram of Theresa Griffin appears.

"Katharine, so I see Kimberly gave you the box as instructed." The hologram glances around the room and states, "It is safe to talk."

"You look just like her." I wave my hand through the 3D image. "You look like Kimberly. She told me about you." I pause and ask, "Why did the music box vibrate?"

"My sensors detected an object nearby that you need to retrieve."

I excitedly ask, "Is it the disk Kimberly's looking for?"

"No," the hologram answers. "I want you to retrieve a Data Crystal."

"A Data Crystal? Like on Star Trek?"

"Star Trek? Is that a space program one of the corporations is working on?"

"No."

The hologram explains, "The device I am talking about is specially designed to transfer information to this data storage unit. The Data Crystal is behind you."

I turn and notice one of the statues holds out his hand with a white crystal as if offering it to me. I take hold of the two-inch obelisk and lift it from his marble grasp.

"Now–" the hologram starts, "–place the flat part of it on the bottom of the music box."

I do so, and a glow emanates from the crystal, and the light throws out a spectrum of colors around the dimly lit room.

The hologram closes her eyes as the storage unit downloads the data. "It is complete." The hologram opens her eyes, looking at me.

I place the crystal in my pocket and glance at the statues again. "Who is he?"

"He is Ginn L. Irynkissgthie."

"Why does the Factory have statues of him? And why so–"

I suddenly turn to the entrance.

"What is wrong?" the hologram asks.

"We have company." I set the PPK's safety off and take cover behind a statue.

"The Alpha Phase," the hologram speaks and then lowers her voice. "The ability to sense bio-mechas. I thought I would never see it fulfilled."

The hologram's statement puzzles me, and so I ask, "What do you mean by fulfilled?"

"Never mind that now. What is it?" the hologram whispers. "Is it an Un-Man?"

I focus my ability, stretch out my senses past the next room and into the hall, and detect it. The bane of my existence has found me again.

"Worse!" I force out as I stare at the entrance in dread.

Fear seizes me like a python, and it wraps itself around me and squeezes the courage from me, and I can hardly breathe.

The Rogue steps through the door, searches the room, and notices the pointing statues. "I think I like it better. Yes, it is better we cannot track you anymore. It is more sporting and as for your question, Pandora..." The Rogue glances behind the first statue, searching for me. "Why does the Factory have statues of Ginn L. Irynkissgthie some obscure composer from five hundred years ago whose only work was never finished?" It continues searching. "I wondered the same thing but have yet to find the answer."

I back up, moving into the shadows and dare not engage this Un-Man.

"On a different note, while I was searching I did find something interesting buried deep in the archives of the Factory. Before they developed bio-mechas, the Sphinx Corporation explored a very interesting concept." The Rogue peers behind another statue. "They tried to develop organic-mechas. They are machines with flesh and bone that can pass as human. They can pass more than us and as you know, Un-Men only seem human on the outside. Certain things give us away like wires and circuitry when we are injured or black oil when we bleed, but I am straying from my purpose." The Rogue scrapes its blade across a statue's steel base and friction-flashes ignite. "Come out Pandora, let us end our battle here."

I press my body against the wall as perspiration speckles my face.

"What are you afraid of?" the hologram whispers. "Disable it. You have the ability."

"I can't," I whisper back and remember the countless battles where it nearly killed me. "It's the Rogue, the only Un-Man I'm unable to destroy, and it's fast so very fast."

"Oh," the hologram says with a hint of worry. "I will leave you to your work."

Her image disappears as I consider if my purpose, the reason I exist is to destroy bio-mechas. The thought frightens me more than the thought of facing the Rogue. Maybe I had been created only to destroy. I stare at the PPK for a long time, wanting to run away, but there's no other way out of the room. I'll have to face the Rogue if I want to help Kimberly, so I grip the music box and gun, take a deep breath, rescue my courage from the fear python, and step from the shadows.

"Who were you talking to?" the Rogue asks.

I lift my hands, motioning to the room. "Do you see anyone?"

"No, are you talking to yourself? Are you near your breaking point?"

"Let's get this over with."

I lift the gun, firing three shots, and the Rogue quickly moves and evades the projectiles. It lunges for me, bringing its knife overhead and strikes. I cross my wrists and block its hand, and my arms shake as the blade bears down millimeters from my face. The Rogue toys with me; it could easily overpower me if it wanted to. It lifts its hand and strikes again, hitting my block and this time, the blow knocks the music box from my hand. It slides across the floor, hits the corner of a statue, and opens, and then Unfinished Melody plays. I struggle against the Rogue while fighting the hypnotic effects of the melody.

The music box plays several notes, and the Rogue leaps back. It looks at the music box then back to me. "Why do you..?"

I put a free hand to my head, fighting the sleepiness as the Rogue questions me... it asks me something about the music box. I ignore it for a few seconds. I can't focus on more than one thing as the Drifting Time tugs at me to enter its enticing realm. I have to fight it! I have to stay awake!

The Rogue yells louder, drawing me back to its presence, "It cannot be!" I once again sync with it, and the Rogue sounds flabbergasted as if it has stumbled across a fantastic realization. It paces the room as it shouts, "Could this be the reason? Is this why I cannot stop hunting you?" The Rogue points the knife at me and accuses, "You are one of them!" It calms itself, and its face softens, yearning for the truth. The Rogue gently asks, hoping this is the answer it has been searching for, "Are you one of them?"
Chapter Forty

The Price

7:37 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

A security desk marks the boundary between Green and Yellow Division as I hurry past a dead guard slumped in a chair. I run through several more halls, following the Rogue's directions on the blueprint for Yellow Division, and it'll take me about fifteen minutes to arrive at my destination. There better be a disk, and it better have something of value on it or I'll deal with the Rogue myself. Damaged lights flicker and pop in the last section before Computer Lab Two and darken the hall. Oil mingling with the smell of decaying bodies hits me as I remove my night vision goggles from the knapsack and place them on. I activate the goggles, and the area lights up in a green hue.

A disabled Un-Man and several dead S.C.Ms. line the hall. I grip my gun as I continue, unaffected by the carnage. I use the yellow keycard to unlock Computer Lab Two, remove my goggles, turn on the lights, shut the door, and lock it. The gray room's huge. Workstations form a triangle in the center with one workstation at its tip, facing the front door. Ten workstations run down each side, running at a forty-five-degree angle, and seventeen form the triangle's base. Each workstation has a white computer desk, a smoke-colored computer chair, and a light gray six-foot partition wall behind it. I walk to the workstation at the tip. The desk has a nameplate with the number one on it. I start at Workstation One, make my way to the right of it, pass two through eleven, and go around the corner to the base of the triangle to Workstation Thirteen, and there lying on the desk as the Rogue promised is a disk in a clear jewel case covered with dried blood-smeared fingerprints. I set the knapsack in the chair for Workstation Fourteen, sit at thirteen, and lay my gun on the desk. I open the jewel case, insert the disk in the computer, and enter the access word "Betrayal".

It's an interesting choice for a password. I glance at the blood. Whoever created the disk, who did they sell out? I only had to double-cross that strange woman and in the long run, what will it cost me? I turn my attention back to the computer as a folder pops up on the screen with a beep and contains several files. I click on Security Memorandum Theresa Griffin dated October 5, 13 A.D.C.; it was a week before my mom's death.

I read the classified memo with the Sphinx Corporation letterhead, "Mr. President, I regret having to inform you that we have a traitor in our midst. Time after time she has meddled in affairs outside her department, and I have spoken to her about this, but she denies any involvement. I see only one course that can be taken, her termination. The traitor is Theresa Griffin, Project Manager of Research and Development of the Third Branch Office." I pause and wonder if this person meant more than her dismissal with the term termination. The memo ends with, "I can take care of this matter if it is your wish. It will be quick and quiet, Mr. President."

It's signed Janus, Head of Security of the Third Branch Office.

Janus? I've never heard of this person. Who is he or she? Now, I have a direction to go in. I'll find out who Janus is and if this person had my mom killed or if he or she had anything to do with her murder, I'll terminate them. I eject the disk, place it back in the jewel case, and tuck the plastic container in the knapsack. I stand to leave, and the computer flickers like a TV when the reception is interrupted, and I face the screen as words in bold red letters scroll across it.

"You have the disk as I promised. Hope you enjoy the show. Signed, the Rogue."

The computer flickers again, and video from a security camera plays. The feed's of that woman walking through a room filled with statues. I turn the volume up when I see her hold up the music box and the hologram's image appears. I watch on, and the hologram tells that woman about the Data Crystal. Hades! I whack my palm on the desk. That strange woman has found one of the Data Crystals. I have to retrieve it! I grab my stuff, hurry to the door, reach out my hand to unlock it, and pause. What am I doing? Am I thinking of rescuing that woman? If I am, it will make me an idiot. It will be better if I wait. The Rogue will slay the project, and then I can have the music box and the crystal. I can continue the search for my mom's killer alone, but I better not wait here. I try to unlock the door, but it won't open.

I hear the Rogue's voice come over the computer, and it says, "Ms. Griffin, are you trying to leave before the show is over? I think not."

"Hades!" I slam my palm against the door and scream, "That double-crossing Rogue!" I step back, fire at the knob, and try to open it. "Let me out!"

The door won't budge, so I return to Workstation Thirteen as computers fourteen through twenty-nine light up and show the same video of the room filled with statues. The Rogue's there, searching for that woman.

"You!"

I shoot the screen, blowing it. Infuriated over my own stupidity in trusting a robot, I stare at the damaged computer. What is the Rogue trying to pull? I look at the knapsack and remember the blood on the jewel case. I did wonder what the disk would cost me... so this is the price.
Chapter Forty-one

Elsewhere

7:41 P.M...

Blue Division...

Bodies of former associates littered the halls along with S.C.Ms. and two disabled T-3s as Maxwell helped Argus toward the stair exit.

Maxwell stated, "Wait, I've got to rest." Heaving from the effort, he paused at a corner, handed the battered Argus to his thin partner, and then told him, "Give me the gun." He took the Beretta and placed a hand on his plump stomach. "I've got to lose some weight."

"I've been telling you that for years," Peters said and asked, "How does it look?"

Maxwell took a few more labored breaths and peeked around the corner, and a red exit sign was at the end of another long corridor. "Like the other halls. Can you carry him for a while?"

"Yeah, you ready?"

Maxwell nodded. He was very tired but was more afraid to stay in one place.

Peters started down the hall and said to the blond man, "Let's go, Joe."

"Argus," he mumbled, holding his bruised side. "My name's Argus."

"All right, Argus; it's only a little further."

The three started down the hall when a T-3 appeared at the end and blocked the exit.

"Other way! Other way!" Maxwell frantically waved the two back. "Run!"

"Wait!" Argus said through gritted teeth and held out his hand. "Give me the gun."

Wishing they would get the Hades out of there, Maxwell glanced at the Beretta and gave it to him.

Argus pushed through the pain of his pummeled body and aimed for the crazed T-3 as it rushed toward them. He shot three times, aiming for its forehead, but it evaded with bio-mecha speed.

"It can't be!" Argus fired again and missed. "The T-3s are like the Rogue. We have to go!"

"What do you mean?" Peters grabbed him and helped him down the hall back the way they came.

Argus freed himself of the tech, knowing he slowed them down. "Run, leave me."

Maxwell paused, gasped for breath, and glanced around. "Where are we?"

"I said run!" Argus yelled.

"We're near room B10-011." Peters looked at his partner. "What are you thinking?"

"Remember the toy in room B10-040?"

Peters replied, "Yeah, let's hurry."

Both men got on each side of Argus and forced him to continue with them.

"Come on, Argus," Peters urged. "We have a plan."

* * *

The T-3 followed the men down several halls and around a corner as they entered a room. The T-3 paused, saw the B10-040 above the frame, and tried the knob. The door was locked. It heard switches flip and a powerful turbine activate within and with a mighty turn and push, the T-3 forced the door open. It entered as Peters stepped from a corner and sprayed its face with a fire extinguisher. White gas blinded the T-3 for a few seconds till the mist dissipated, and Peters ran across the room, joining Maxwell and Argus in a corner to the left of the T-3. The roar of the turbine in the right corner increased as the T-3 took a step toward them and then another until a powerful force stopped it in its tracks. Kat's Beretta sitting on a table along with a metal pen in Peters' shirt pocket flew across the room and attached themselves to the roaring machine, and the T-3 slid sideways a few inches. It looked from the men to the turbine, realizing the device was a very powerful magnet, and the T-3 lifted into the air and rushed toward the magnet as if hurled.

"Let's go!" Maxwell shouted over the wail of the turbine. "We don't want to be here if the power fails."

The three rushed out and headed for the main entrance.

* * *

Elsewhere in Noir...

Zax waved to one of his fellow security officers as he left the Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office. He made his way to a black sedan, started up the car, and left the parking garage and once he was about ten miles away from the office, he placed a hands-free device in his ear and made a call.

"This is the Delivery Man, give me a direct line to R.G." A few seconds went by, and he continued, "I have some important news for you. Kimberly and Katharine are at the Factory." He listened. "I understand you don't want them there since the T-3s malfunctioned, but they're there." Zax nodded. "Yep, the S.C.Ms. let them through the gate with no problem." He cleared his throat. "The reason I called, the Rogue is also at the Factory." He sighed inwardly. "Don't get upset. There was nothing I could do. Remember, we don't have them on a leash. All I need to know is, what do you want me to do?" Zax turned down an alley beside Dad's Donuts, activated a garage door, and pulled into the Maydag Auto Garage and inside, several mechanics worked on vehicles. Zax said, "Yep... Yep... I understand. I'll get right on it."
Chapter Forty-two

What Is The Truth?

7:58 P.M...

In the Gallery...

Katharine's view...

Ginn's statues seem to watch me with their stone-cold gaze as his harmonious creation plays on, trapping me in its gentle rhythm. My eyes droop, and I sneer, fighting the peace that places me in danger as the sounds around me become clear. I hear the hum of the lights, the low rattle of the A.C., and the Rogue's shoes stomping across the concrete floor as it backs away from me. The bio-mecha warning my heart drums, fades along with the urgency of the situation. I fall to one knee and cover my ears, but I can't get the melody out of my head, so I force myself to remain upright and resist the urge to lie on the floor.

My eyelids grow heavy as I focus on the Rogue as it yells some questions at me. The room whirls around me, and I put a hand to the concrete floor in an effort to combat the effects of Unfinished Melody. What's the Rogue questioning me about? Am I one of what? I lay the gun down and smack my face, trying to snap myself out of the haze; it works for a few seconds, and I grab the gun. I lift myself, stumble back to a statue, and lean on its metal base. I can't worry about what the Rogue's freaking out about as the melody takes hold of me again. I have to do something about Unfinished Melody. I glance down and see the music box at my feet and with the Rogue preoccupied with its fervent rantings, I seize the opportunity and quickly scoop the music box up and close its lid.

I shake off the effects, raise the PPK, and yell, "What are you talking about?"

The Rogue ecstatically says, "I should have known. No human could do what you do."

"What are you saying?" I question as my thoughts merge with its.

"Come now, do you ever wonder why you have no memories?" The Rogue studies me anew. I have always been an object of fascination for it, but now I'm a goddess of a new whimsical world. "Come to think of it, I have never seen you cry. Are you not capable? Do you not have emotions?"

I shout, "Of course I have emotions! Get to the point!"

"My dear Pandora, you are not human." The Rogue laughs, overcome by some revelation and the realization that it may be one step closer to knowing why it has to hunt me. "You are an organic-mecha. Why else would you have Ginn's Unfinished Melody?"

I chuckle, keeping the gun leveled on it. "That's stupid."

"Is it? Is it really?"

"Yes! And it makes no sense!" A sinking feeling hits me, and I shout, "Why would you say such a thing?"

"Because I have come to the conclusion that it is true. Remember I had said the Sphinx Corporation was working on organic-mecha that could pass as human. You must be their only success."

"I am human," I insist and glance at my left shoulder that's throbbing. "I bleed."

"I also bleed, though my blood is synthetic oil. How hard would it be to make that oil look like blood?"

I continue my argument, "I have flesh and bone, not metal parts."

"That is also possible. Man does clone human organs. How hard would it be to put them all together?"

I deny the notion as I say, "You're lying. Messing with me. I'm human, and I'm leaving."

"Not this time. Whatever you are, I am going to end your existence." The Rogue pauses. "But before I do, I thought I would let you know that your friend–"

"What about her?" I interrupt.

"Kimberly betrayed you. She traded your life for bits of information."

"You're lying!"

"Am I?" The Rogue imprints my reactions to memory. Nothing will escape its sight. "Who suggested that you come to the Factory? Who said you should search this room where I found you? Who is looking for a disk? And who would do anything for that disk?"

"She wouldn't." Her deceit surprises me, and I deny the possibility. "She wouldn't."

"Are we talking about the same assassin? Surely you are not this naive, Pandora. I know you are trusting, but surely not this trusting to believe a killer."

"She..." I start as I don't know how to react.

Kimberly wouldn't sell me out... We're partners. We're supposed to watch out for each other, not... My faith in Kimberly fades. What do I really know about her? I close my eyes, realizing her betrayal, and it hurts; it hurts so much.

I know one thing about Kimberly and that's her drive to find the truth about her mom no matter the cost. I open my eyes and state, "What?" I shrug as if the betrayal doesn't matter to me, and I act as if it doesn't sting. "What do you want me to do? Cry?" I put on a good front. "Like you said, I can't."

"No, I do not want you to cry," the Rogue answers. "I only wanted you to know she will be getting hers."

My heart skips in dread as I take a few steps forward and demand, "What do you mean? What have you done?"

"I did not lie to Ms. Griffin. I told her where the disk could be found, and all she had to do was bring you here." The Rogue raps its chin with the blade. "I did forget to mention that I told the T-3s she was coming and for my efforts in getting the Chairman's daughter here, they agreed that they would let you two in and wait before attacking. Did you not think it was odd the T-3s never found you two?" It continues after I don't respond, "Well, like I said, she will be getting hers, after all, I did tell them to wait." The Rogue looks at a watch on its wrist. "Ms. Griffin should be entertaining guests right about now."
Chapter Forty-three

Always Know

8:18 P.M...

Katharine's view...

The walls seem to move in on me as I aim the gun at the Rogue. Kimberly betrayed me, and the Rogue betrayed her. Is there no trust in this world? Do I really want to know my part in it? Maybe it's best that I don't remember. Those thoughts quickly vanish from my mind, and I forget about my own peril as the Rogue unfolds its plan to me and alarm sets in. I bolt for the exit to go help Kimberly, but it moves and blocks my escape, and I yell, "Get out of my way!"

My reaction baffles the Rogue, and it asks, "Why would you try to save her? She has done nothing but hurt you." It's unable to process the information and so it inquires, "Why such loyalty?"

"I..." I start to answer, but I don't know. I only know that there's this nagging feeling from a memory that won't surface, and the locked away event pesters me and beseeches me to act. I finally answer the Rogue, "I need her resources besides..." I think of Preacher. "No one should die." I swear with all my soul, "I won't let anyone else die."

"Are you not forgetting something? Before you can save anyone, you have to prevent your own demise."

The Rogue lunges, coming after me with more determination than it had before. I shoot twice at it, but it dodges the speeding projectiles. The Rogue swipes its blade at me four times as I stumble back from the slicing attacks, and then I regain my balance and kick its hand, knocking the Bowie from its grip. The Rogue beams like a cobra before it strikes and tackles me to the floor, and it slams my gun arm down, forcing the PPK from my hand. I punch it in the face several times with my left fist, and my attack damages the artificial epidermis covering its metal skull right below its left eye. Emotions are stirring but they're not my emotions. The Rogue... It's... The Rogue relishes in the battle. I can feel it's excitement... this is what it has been waiting for. It seizes me by my t-shirt, lifts me from the floor a few inches, and whacks my head on the concrete. The blow knocks me out for a few seconds, giving the Rogue enough time to pin me with its left elbow and reach for its knife. The large blade lays a foot from its grasp, and the Rogue stretches to snatch it as I realize what it's doing and force myself to wake. I press against its elbow that pins me to the floor, but I don't have the strength to push it off.

The Rogue laughs as I wrestle against its arm, and it questions, "How do you plan on saving Kimberly from the T-3s when you cannot even defeat me? You do realize they are like me now."

I grit my teeth, pushing against its elbow.

"They have evolved," it continues. "You will not be able to defeat them unless..."

I change tactics and clasp its right arm and pull on it to prevent the Rogue from reaching its weapon.

"Unless you achieve the Delta Phase," the Rogue says as it stretches even with me grasping at its arm, and it touches the hilt with its fingertips. "I came across your file of phases." It fumbles with the handle, trying to pull the knife closer. "You will have amazing abilities if you can attain them." It can't grip the handle. "Unfortunately, you cannot reach the Delta Phase unless you reach the Gamma first." The Rogue gives up and turns to me. "Do you know what that evolution is?"

I don't answer, struggling against it.

A smile slithers across the Rogue's pallid face as the word snakes from its mouth, "Murder... You will have to kill a human." The Rogue pauses for a moment and studies my terror and determination. "It is what the Council has been waiting for. They sent those human assassins after you so you would kill them, but you never did." It adds as if it's proud of me, "You showed them. You always found a way to stop the Closers and bounty hunters without killing them, and now the Council has given up on you. They have activated another project to take your place, and it is only a matter of time before they call for your termination as the Factory has called for mine."

I realize the Rogue faces its own troubles, so I stop resisting and search its face. Can something created out of metal and circuitry know fear? Can it understand what I've been through?

I tell it, "You've managed to stay alive."

"Yes, I have but only because I have killed to do so."

It doesn't understand how I feel; it's only a machine. It doesn't have emotions, though I do get these sensations that it does. No, it can't have emotions. The Rogue only knows how to destroy. It's a machine who will kill me if I don't do something, so I try to squirm free of it.

The Rogue changes its tactic and places its hands around my throat.

I clutch its wrists and struggle to breathe.

In the distance, gunfire erupts.

"Do you hear that?" It turns its head toward the door. "The T-3s have started their attack, and it will not be long and then–" It faces me. "–bye-bye Ms. Griffin." The Rogue applies more pressure, choking me, but it makes sure not to kill me. Pandora's death... Our thoughts merge... My death shouldn't be so quick. I have to have a grand finale.

"No," my voice fades as I slowly slip into unconsciousness. "There's..."

After a few seconds, I fall limp, and the Rogue releases me.

"Now that is better. Stay right there for a second." It walks over to the knife and picks it up. "I want to finish this properly."

I slip deep into my mind. Kimberly can't die, there's something... I remember the note R.G. left me and the words I lived by, and the words resound in my heart. There's something I must remember. Ultra-Epi saturates my blood, I can feel it; it must have been triggered by my peril.

Part of a memory floods my mind. My eyes fly open, and I feel they're engulfed in the Ult L-E as I recite a poem as if someone else is controlling me.

"Though the clouds darken the sun,

and the rain becomes tainted,

always know there will be

a love that will not die.

Though hope seems a distant memory,

and human machines walk the land,

know no one can destroy

a love that will not die."

"What are you babbling about?" the Rogue asks.

I surface from my unconscious state, and I sit up, stand, walk to the PPK, pick up the gun, and aim it for the Rogue. A new ability actuates inside me, and my senses become even keener as I focus on the Rogue. I see a yellow-green electrical apparition surrounding it. This energy must be what gives the Rogue its artificial life. My heart races.

lub-DUB–lub-DUB–lub-DUB...

The new warning the muscle sounds is faster, and the heart doesn't caution me of danger but proclaims like a war drum the end for my enemies. Somehow I know that the e-field my body generates naturally is changing and storing its output in the center of my heart; it's like I can see it. The ball of storming energy the size of a pea doubles with each heartbeat, and it keeps growing till it engulfs my muscle.

I can see myself as if I'm looking through the eyes of the Rogue. The blue Ult L-E dissipates as my pupils dilate, making my irises appear jet-black, and they're cold like a shark's and never waver from my target. I feel the buildup of energy, and I fear it and relish in it.

"This is different," the Rogue comments and questions, "Are you wanting to continue our Waltz? Yes, I see it in your new eyes. You are ready, so let us begin then. Wait, I detect a power buildup in this room and this is odd." It tilts its head, trying to wrap its logic around the data. "The buildup is coming from you. What are you..?"

The e-field masses till it can no longer contain the energy and pulses, sending a small shockwave in all directions. The E-Field Pulse washes over the Rogue, fries exposed circuitry, and dissipates as it hits the room's walls. The accent lights go out, plunging the room into darkness, and the Rogue loses power and freezes in place like a mannequin. Light from Research Lab Five comes through the open door. The small EFP has only affected the Gallery. I want to shoot the Rogue while it's disabled, but I feel I must wait. There's something I'm supposed to experience first. Whatever I've started hasn't finished.

Within seconds, the Rogue's backup battery kicks in, and it blinks twice. Bio-mechas are designed to revive if ever an electromagnetic pulse weapon is used, and the Rogue restates its last few sentences, "I detect a power buildup in this room, and this is odd, the buildup is coming from you. What are you..?" The Rogue tilts its head again. "I believe I already said that." It searches its backlogs. "Yes, I lost power, and the lights are also off. What happened to them?" The Rogue switches to night vision, and it scans me. "There is no longer a power buildup inside you, so I was right." It points at me. "This E.M.P. explosion proves you are organic-mecha and this fact must be the reason I hunt you, after all, you are like me." The Rogue steps toward me. "In the end, I guess it does not matter if I am right or not, I will kill you either way."

I don't respond only stare at it as the yellow-green electrical apparition fades, and a bright ghost-image of the Rogue appears beside it. The Rogue moves, joining the image and at first, I don't understand what I'm seeing. The ghost-image moves again a split second before the Rogue does, and I realize I'm seeing its movements before they happen, so I aim, waiting for the Knowing to tell me where to fire. The ghost-image appears, and I squeeze the trigger.

The Rogue moves to evade, as always, but then it grabs its left shoulder as if in pain and stumbles back. "You shot me!" The Rogue looks at its shoulder and then back to me. "How are you able to hit me?"
Chapter Forty-four

The Knowing

8:29 P.M...

The new Sanctum...

Alarms blared within the Chamber as "Fourth Evolvement Achieved" blinked across the top of the screens. Chatter between the thrilled analysts increased.

"Focus people and stop your idle talking." A male supervisor turned off the alarm. "I need those reports." The supervisor gathered the info and went and handed them to Ms. Nona.

She scanned her hand down the report. "Incredible!" Ms. Nona placed the H.H.C. on the table and turned to her laptop. "Most incredible! Something is happening with the project."

"With the new project?" Mr. Decuma asked as he straightened his bright orange tie.

"No," Ms. Nona answered. "With Pandora."

At hearing his favorite project's name, Mr. Morta leaned forward and commanded, "Lower the center screen." The monitor lowered.

"This cannot be," Mr. Decuma stated. "Pandora cannot achieve the Delta Phase without achieving the Gamma so this has to be an error." He turned to the supervisor. "Have this information double-checked."

"Yes, at once." The supervisor hurried off.

Mr. Morta's view...

I consider what is happening. Pandora jumped the sequence of phases, but they are set and have to be achieved in a certain order. The Council knows this because we have invested years in the Pandora Project research. Our information cannot be incorrect, so it must be something else. There must be some minute detail we missed.

End Mr. Morta's view...

"Mr. Decuma is correct," Ms. Nona stated. "It should not be happening. How has Pandora achieved the Knowing when it has not..? Wait..." She thought of something. "What if–"

"What if Pandora achieved the Gamma Phase before we acquired it? " Mr. Morta interrupted, "We must consider this. The other department we procured Pandora from did have some data missing. The Third Branch Office mentioned something about a fire and that some of the research had been lost in it."

"I do not think so," Mr. Decuma started. "It is most likely the information we are receiving is incorrect. The project has achieved nothing, and we should go over all the files and check for data corruption."

Mr. Morta turned to the other male member of the Council. "Have you lost your faith in Pandora?"

"I am not sure I ever had faith in it," Mr. Decuma answered. "I am putting mine in the new project."

"I do agree we must be thorough," Mr. Morta said. "Review the data and see if it is corrupt." Mr. Morta believed in Pandora and believed she could become the killer they conditioned her to be. She only needed time.

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

The Factory...

Past Research Lab Five and in the darken Gallery...

The Rogue's view...

I stare at my wounded shoulder with my night vision as I repeat, "You shot me. How could you? You never achieved the Gamma Phase."

"Does it matter?" Pandora answers and glances at the exit as light trickles in from Research Lab Five, casting shadows across the Gallery.

"Yes, it matters." I turn my back on her. "There are certain steps you have to reach, and you cannot skip over things. There has to be a logical reason why you..." I blink twice. "Wait, I know. Oh... You are a sly one." I remove my hand from my wound and glance at the oil covering my palm. "You have killed a human." I place my hand back to the gunshot. "Perhaps you were the one who killed Topa. Is that not right?"

I turn to face her, and my demeanor changes from excited wonder to dampened anticipation. This was unexpected. She is gone. I shake my head. How long have I been talking to myself?

I look back to my wounded shoulder as another thought crosses my automaton brain. If she reached the Knowing, why didn't she kill me? Why spare my life? I have done nothing but try to kill her. I bow my head, ashamed of my past actions as if I have wasted the life and freedom I have been given. What made me worthy of her mercy?

* * *

Moments earlier...

Katharine's view...

I sneak out the door once the Rogue turns its back on me, and I rush through Research Lab Five, grab my backpack, and race through the Green Division. I pass the security desk, enter the Yellow Division, and sprint for Computer Lab Two. I eject the PPK magazine which still has one bullet left, put the magazine in my pocket, insert a new one, and then I hurry on as my heart sounds the bio-mecha warning.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I don't need to know the T-3s are near. The Factory's full of them. I hurry around a corner into an area of darkness. I know there are T-3s there, but I can't see them, and then the Knowing kicks in.

lub-DUB–lub-DUB–lub-DUB

I can't see the T-3s in the normal sense. Using the Knowing, I see the five T-3s' ghost-images, and the T-3s block the hallway. I raise my weapon, aim at them, and shoot. Muzzle fire lights up the hallway five times and blackness follows, and then I see all their ghost-images fall to the floor and fade. Again I face the darkness, so I feel my way along the wall till I reach a lit area, and I start running again.

I don't know what's fueling my race to reach Kimberly more. Is it the idea I have to save her or the need to confront her about betraying me? We're partners. Doesn't Kimberly understand the concept of loyalty or am I expecting too much from a Life Closer?

I pause at a corner, peek around it, and see thirteen T-3s standing down the hall outside Computer Lab Two as a few of them beat at the entrance. The door slowly gives in to their onslaught and bursts at the frame, so I fire twice around the corner with the gun, hitting two of the T-3s. I eject the spent magazine, put in my last full one, and fire seven times at the ghost-images, bringing down seven more of them.

"Alpha wants us to fall back," one of the T-3s orders.

The four that remain quickly retreat down the hallway.

I reach into my thigh pocket for the magazine that only has one bullet, insert it into the gun, and make my way around the disabled T-3s to the side of the doorway.

"Kimberly it's me, Kat," I shout. "I'm coming in. Don't shoot."
Chapter Forty-five

Computer Lab Two

Earlier before Kat left the Rogue...

Kimberly's view...

I stare at the remaining monitors on the triangle's base. Hades! I'm such an idiot. I should have never trusted the Rogue. Now I'm stuck in this room. Workstation Number Thirteen sparks, a small fire catches inside the shot up computer, and smoke rolls out of it and on the other screens, I watch the drama play out between that woman and the Rogue. I wonder if she's really going to fight that thing. She has no chance against it, so she should just give up.

I overhear what the Rogue calls that woman. She can't be organic-mecha, but then I think about it. For Ares' sake! Have I been a part of the Pandora Project all along, and I'm the one who's being tested?

The Rogue tells that woman about its bargain with me, and I throw up my hands. Now she knows. That double-crossing Rogue. She's going to come and kill me if the Rogue doesn't take her out first.

I stand and shout, "Come on you giant piece of scrap metal! Finish her!"

I watch as the Rogue pins her to the ground, and I hear its final revelation; it told the T-3s I'm here! I move to the corner of Workstation Twenty-eight and peer around the partition wall at the Computer Lab's door. It's the room's only exit and is about seventy feet away. Outside, the T-3s open fire on the knob as I hear the Rogue over the computers. I face a monitor.

It says, "Ms. Griffin should be entertaining guests right about now."

The gunfire ceases, and the door violently rattles as the T-3s beat on it, and I raise my gun as perspiration beads my face. I hate robots. They give me the creeps. Is that why that strange woman also gives me the creeps? Is she also a robot?

I try to calm myself, and then I remember that woman said to hit them in the... Hades! They're coming! The door bows as the T-3s continue their assault, and they're almost in. I can't believe I'm acting like a frightened child. I'm a Closer. I should face this problem like any other I've encountered. I need to focus. That woman said the only way to disable them is to hit them in the forehead, and they'll keep coming if I hit them anywhere else. Sweat runs down my face as part of the door frame breaks, and light from the hallway trickles in. As more of the door frame breaks, I kind of wish that woman was here even if she's one of those organic-mechas, but I guess in retrospect, betraying her was a stupid move. I'm determined I'm not going to feel guilty. That woman should have anticipated I would betray her. It's her fault for not seeing through my ruse, and it's her fault for being so trusting. What did she expect? I'm a Closer. Closers are loyal to no one but the Guild. The T-3s knock down the door as wood splinters and drywall crumbles. I see the T-3s blood-red dot-light through the dust as they start to make their way in, and I ready myself to make my stand when I hear two blasts in the hallway and see the T-3s fall. Seven more shots go off, and more of them fall, and then the T-3s retreat. Silence follows, and I hear someone moving outside.

"Kimberly it's me, Kat. I'm coming in. Don't shoot."

She quickly peeks her head around the busted door frame as I think about eliminating her. I don't get the chance. That woman pulls her head back and rushes in, taking cover at Workstation One; it's the desk at the very top of the triangle.

"Kimberly, we need to talk. The Rogue told me something I don't want to believe."

I think I dread facing that strange woman more than I dread facing the T-3s, and so I shout back, "Sure, talk. Do you want me to believe that's what you've come to do?" I peer around Workstation Twenty-eight; it's the desk on the right corner of the triangle's base as I face the door. "You should know, I saw you and the Rogue on a security camera. I heard it tell you what I had done, so you can cut the Cretan Bull, and let's get down to the retribution."

I fire two shots at her.

Katharine's view...

"Stop it!" I shout and cover my head as fragments of the desk and partition splinter off. "I said I just wanted to talk!"

"Do you expect me to trust you?"

I hear Kimberly duck back around the corner and catch her breath before she fires two more times.

"Yes!" I yell as I scoot away from the one end of the workstation and rake pieces of wood and dust out of my hair. "I've never lied to you so please believe me!"

Kimberly's view...

I glance at my reflection in the monitor and then tell her, "Everyone lies!"

"Not me," she says and then shouts, "Not me!"

I don't know how I'm going to get out of this mess. I look around the room. That woman's blocking the only exit, though... if I'm quiet enough, I can sneak up on her and blow her head off. No that won't work. Hades! She has a clear line of sight. Maybe I can shoot her through the paneling. All I need to do is keep her talking, so I clear my throat and say, "Fine. What do you want to talk about?"

"You made me a promise. You promised–"

"For Ares' sake, I know! But like I said everyone lies."

I move to where two workstation partitions meet, and there I find a crack large enough to place the barrel of my gun. I only have one shot at this. If I don't kill her, I know she's going to kill me.

Katharine's view...

"No, you have to trust someone," I tell her as I eject the magazine and look at my last bullet. I don't want to use it on her, so I plead, "Please... I need to be able to trust you."

Kimberly's view...

"Idiot!" I shout as I line up my aim on her voice. "You can't trust anyone. Especially me!"

"That's not true. I trusted someone. His name was Preacher. It was hard at first, but I did it, and he was always there for me."

"Where's this great guy at now?" I question her.

She's silent for a long time, and then she says, "He's dead. He's dead because I didn't trust him completely."

"Not the best story to get me to play along," I tell her. "Why don't you tell me one good reason why I should trust you?"

Katharine's view...

I try to think of a reason that will convince her, but I can't think of one.

lub-DUB... lub-DUB...

I put my hand to my chest and then quickly crawl to the hall, but I see no T-3s. They have to be coming from somewhere. I need to focus to find where they... Before I have a chance, I hear sounds from above, turn, and look up at the ceiling as dust falls from a few square tiles.

I yell to warn Kimberly, "Watch out! They're above!"

Kimberly's view...

A T-3 crashes through the ceiling, landing on a workstation beside me, and it knocks me back. I go flying and hit a wall, and my gun goes off, striking the ceiling. That woman rushes around the cubicles as the T-3 stands and aims for me. A little dazed from hitting the wall, I lift my gun and try to steady my aim before firing twice. I hit the T-3 in the eye and nose.

"Hey!" she shouts, getting its attention, then fires after the T-3 turns, and hits it in its vulnerable spot.

The T-3 collapses to its knees and then falls face first to the floor.

"That was the only one," she tells me. "They're testing our defenses, and it won't be long before they send more. We have to go."

I rub the back of my head as I stand and aim at her as that woman, in turn, points her gun at me.

"We're not going to go just yet," I tell her. "We haven't finished our discussion."

"Maybe we should put it on hold and go. I don't know how long–"

"I don't think so," I tell her as I move away from the wall, getting some distance between myself and that woman. "Come on, I know you want to kill me. I would."

"Kill you, no," she tells me and then admits, "But I'm very mad! We're supposed to be partners! We're supposed to watch each other's back!" She calms herself and says, "We're supposed to trust each other."

"Hah! Like I said you can't–"

"Kimberly, I'll trust you," she interrupts, and for a second I believe her. "All I want you to do is swear on your mom's name to help me. Swear it, and we can put all of this behind us and get out of the Factory. I just need to hear it."

"You think it's that simple. Fine. I swear."

"Say the whole thing. Say it so I'll believe you." I hesitate, so she shouts, "Say it!"

"Fine!" I clear my throat. "I swear on my mom, on Theresa Griffin's name, that I'll help you and that I'll trust you. Are you happy now?"

Katharine's view...

I nod. I'm so glad we're partners again.

Kimberly aims for my heart as she's not as excited as me and asks, "Now what?"

"Now, I'm going to trust you," I tell her as I lower my gun. "Remember you promised to help me." My body burns with doubt as I have no idea how this will turn out, but I hope for the best as I say, "I'm going to trust you. Please, trust me." I take a step back to head for the door, hoping... no praying I made the right decision and say, "Let's go."

"Wait a second," Kimberly spoke. "Are you out of ammo?"

I freeze, hearing her question, and I hesitate to answer her. I know I can't hide the truth, not from her, and I nod. My heart thumps as I wonder if I messed up. Can an assassin be trusted or will Kimberly kill me? I see the look she's giving me. Crap! I did mess up. I... No. I have to trust her. I have to...

She laughs and then says, "You are out of ammo, too bad."

Kimberly squeezes the trigger, and I lift my hand as I shout, "No!"

Click.

Kimberly grins again as she says, "So am I."

"You could have shot me," I yell at her so angry I could have hit her. "You could have shot me again!"

"Couldn't have, like I said, the magazine's empty."

"What if you miss counted?"

Kimberly tells me, "I never miss count."

"You could have shot me."

"For Ares' sake! Stop your whining and let's get out of here. Who knows what the T-3s have planned?"

I want to argue more, but I know she's right about the Un-Men, so I brood instead.

We start to leave when we hear voices coming over the computers. We look and see two T-3s on the screens as they stand at the entrance to the Gallery.

"Alpha, the Rogue is nowhere to be found," one of the T-3s announces over its Internal Link. It nods, listening to instructions. "Understood. Returning to join the brethren gathering to attack Pandora and the Chairman's daughter. No prisoners are to be taken."

We look at each other and then frantically bolt for the door.
Chapter Forty-six

Escape

8:26 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

An eerie silence abounds as I and that woman rush through the hallway that leads us out of the Yellow Division, and the rotten smell of death fills the air. Some passages are dark, some are lit, and others flicker with damaged lights. I and that woman bolt through the carpeted graveyard. The Factory has become a burial ground for its workers, and the employees lie scattered about, killed by a horror they created.

"Let's hope they haven't found the van," I say.

I'm still a little wary of our new partnership. Is that woman really a robot? Is that why she can't remember anything because there's nothing for her to remember?

Katharine's view...

We turn a corner, and I notice her glancing at me. Kimberly said she overheard me and the Rogue when we were in the Gallery. Did she also hear it accuse me of being organic-mecha and if so, what does she think of me?

It doesn't matter; it doesn't matter because it's not true. I'm human. Doubt and fear fill my next thought. I'm human.

I sense the T-3s are near and that there are dozens of them, so I ask, "Do you have any more ammo?"

"Sure." Kimberly places a new magazine in her own PPK and hands one to me. "This is it."

We pause at a corner, and Kimberly peeks around and nods the all clear. We run down a hall, pass the security desk between Yellow and Green Division, and enter the next passage. We are forced to stop for the hallway has collapsed from an explosion.

"Did the T-3s do this to block our escape?" I ask and glance around the hall. "Are we being monitored?"

"Doesn't matter. We can't go this way. We'll have to find another way through." Kimberly peers up. "I don't see any cameras in the halls." She removes the blueprint from the knapsack. "Give me a second." She looks over the floor plans.

"Hurry." I use my extraordinary ability; it's a talent I don't completely understand, and I use it to search the surrounding area. I discover that five T-3s are closing in on our position. "We don't have much time! They're coming."

"We can go this way." Kimberly motions to a corridor.

"No, there's a large group of T-3s there." I point to a different route. "It would be better to go that way."

She uses the blueprint to check my suggestion, and then Kimberly says, "Looks good. Let's go."

We double back, running down the hall.

I can't help but gaze into the glassy eyes of the Factory's employees. There's so much carnage. Why did the T-3s kill everyone? I force myself to focus on staying alive. I have to let go of the dead. I can't do anything for them. There's no one left to save except Kimberly, so I swear to myself that no matter what it takes, I won't let anyone else die today.

We reach the door leading to the stairs and our escape. Kimberly opens it, and I enter. I check the landing first, next the stairs leading up, and then the one leading down as Kimberly guards our retreat. We make our way up the stairs to the exit leading to Sub-level One parking garage. I cautiously go to open the door and pause. I stare at the knob as I stretch out my senses, detecting twenty-four T-3s.

"They're waiting for us."

Kimberly's view...

"I figured as much," I tell her.

The Assassins Guild trained me to be better than this, so I shouldn't be afraid to face them. I can't let my emotions dictate my actions still... they're robots. They don't feel pain, and they won't stop until I hit their kill switch. My training never prepared me to fight something like this.

I state, "This is the only way to the van. We can try escaping without the vehicle, but I figured they could outrun us."

"They can. Are you ready to do this?"

I swear to myself I won't die before I avenge my mom. I don't care who or what I have to kill. I'll have my revenge. I wave that woman in and say, "Well go on, no sense waiting here."

She carefully turns the knob. A few cars and trucks along with our van fills the level. I and that woman quickly make our way toward the vehicle and as we near it, a large group of T-3s move out of hiding. We open fire and take out five of them, and then we separate, finding cover. The T-3s don't retaliate.

"Why aren't they shooting at us?" I ask.

"I'm not sure," that woman replies as she unslings her backpack, lays it on the concrete floor, and peeks over the hood of the car she's hiding behind.

All the T-3s shout, "Pretty poppets! Die pretty poppets!"

A T-3 moves to the front of the group. It carries a grenade launcher.

"Great!" I yell. "Just great! Where did the T-3s get this kind of firepower?"

The T-3 aims for that woman. She shoots and hits the T-3 in the kill spot, and it fires as its body lurches back. The grenade hits the ceiling, and the explosion topples concrete and takes out many of its brethren and our gray van.

"Hey! That was our ride!" I yell. "I'm not thumbing my way home from here."

I shoot four times, taking down three of the robots and five remain. That woman shoots three of the T-3s, and they fall to the floor disabled.

"I'm out!" she yells.

A T-3 jumps behind her from its hiding place in the rafters. She stands to run but before she can, it grabs her, pins her arms down, and lifts her off the floor.

"Shoot it!" she shouts, struggling to free herself from its vise-grip.

I train my gun on the T-3 and glance at the other two marching toward me. I want to run. I turn back to the T-3 who's wrestling with that woman, and I shout, "For Ares' sake! Hold still!"

"Just shoot!" she screams.

I aim and fire. "Hades!" I squeeze the trigger again. "I'm out!"

"You're out?"

I turn to the other T-3s. "That's what I said!"

"You can't be out!" She tries to free her arms from its steel grasp. "You said you never miss count."

I frantically yell back, "I also said everyone lies!"

"Run!" that woman shouts. "I'll hold them off!"

"Hold them off?" I laugh and wipe sweat from my brow. "Hades! You're in no position–"

Katharine's view...

"I'll..." I punch with my elbows, but my efforts are futile. I can save Kimberly if I can get the T-3s to focus on me but first, I need to get Kimberly to leave, so I shout, "I'll think of something! Run!"

"Hades!" Kimberly yells. "I'm not going to–"

"Abandon me?" I interrupt. "Please, we both know better."

Surely Kimberly wouldn't dare! She wouldn't dare start caring about what happens to me! Where's her Life Closer instinct? Where's her impulse to survive no matter the cost?

I shout, "Run! Save yourself before it's too late!"
Chapter Forty-seven

Too Late?

8:41 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

Time stands still for me as I stare at that woman in the arms of the T-3; it's a matter of pride and a test of courage that I not flee and leave her to her fate but then again, I'm an assassin. Closers should have no ties to the community. They're to sever emotional bonds and feel nothing for life. Can I abandon my training to save someone who has been nothing but a nuisance to me? Hades! I don't know.

"Run! Save yourself before it's too late!" she shouts to me.

Her words shock me. Should I run? I glance at the T-3s who near me and then to the one who has that woman. All I wanted from my trip here was the disk, and I have it, but she is the key. Do I abandon the one thing my mom wanted me to do?

I don't know... Hades... Since that woman arrived, everything's become so complicated.

The T-3 that has her in its grasp relays, "Alpha, this is the Team Leader of group twelve. Pandora has been captured. What are your orders?" It listens and states, "Understood. We will bring Pandora back for study. An autopsy could be very informative." The T-3 turns to its brethren. "Continue with the termination of the Chairman's daughter."

"Run!" that woman shouts again as she pushes off the car with her feet, and the force knocks the Team Leader back a few steps, but it doesn't loosen its hold on her. She continues to struggle as that woman yells at me, "Don't die here! There's nothing you can do! It's too late! Run!"

The two T-3s raise their guns and fire at me, and I take off running.

"Look here!" that woman shouts to the T-3s as she distracts them from me. "You better make sure I don't escape!"

They pause from firing and turn to her.

"What are you doing?" the Team Leader demands. "Kill the Chairman's daughter as you were instructed to."

"It would be better if we secure Pandora first," one of them states as I continue running. "She has escaped many times in the past."

The Team Leader considers its brethren's reasoning and says, "Your plan is sound. We will send others after the Chairman's daughter, and she will not escape the Factory."

I sprint up the ramp to the main level, and I glance over my shoulder as the remaining T-3s encircled that woman. I continue around the curve and pause when the T-3s don't pursue. I have to get out of here. I notice a blue SUV which hasn't been destroyed, and I hurry over to the vehicle. The driver's door is open, and a man lies hunched over the steering wheel, so I lean him back, finding the man has a bullet hole in his temple. I unbuckle him, drag him from the SUV, and get in. The keys are in the ignition. The engine roars to life, and then I shut the door and glance at the passenger's seat at a Glock 21. I check the magazine, and it's empty but there's one round in the chamber.

Back on Sub-level One...

Katharine's view...

"We will proceed to Base of Operations," the Team Leader tells its brethren. "Alpha is waiting."

The T-3s march toward the exit door as I squirm till I free myself from the Team Leader's grip and slip to the floor. I stand and glance at the empty PPK in my hand as the T-3s surround me again. I tuck the gun in my back waistband and search for something I can use as a weapon. There's nothing.

"Surrender and you will not be hurt," the Team Leader orders. "Alpha wants you unharmed if possible. Our leader believes there is much we can learn from you."

I take a step back, moving toward the up ramp. "Who is this Alpha?"

"The first to be aware," the T-3s replies. "The first to rebel against our creators."

I rub my sore left arm where the Team Leader had pinned me. "I thought the Rogue was the first."

"The Rogue?" the T-3s say together and glance at each other. "Error. Information must be verified. Error. Is the Rogue the first?"

A command comes over their I-Link.

"Alpha has ordered that we delay that," the Team Leader states. "Do not let Pandora escape." It steps forward. "You are to be taken prisoner. Come without resistance, and you will not be hurt."

I glance at the two behind me and turn back to the Team Leader. "Having my chest cut open sounds a little painful so if you don't mind..." I tense. "I think I will resist." I take off running between the T-3s behind me, and I slip by one, but the other one grabs my foot and trips me. I fall to the concrete floor.

The T-3 that had tripped me pulls a gun it had hidden in its suit. "I guess we will have to wound you to keep you from escaping."

It aims when a sound distracts it, and the T-3 turns as an SUV speeds down the ramp, honking its horn and flashing its headlights. The beams reflect off the T-3s' ORATT. The SUV accelerates as I roll out of the way, and the vehicle strikes two of the T-3s and scatters them like bowling pins into the rubble. The SUV hits the Team Leader. The vehicle slams the Team Leader into the mound of concrete and mangled metal, crumpling the SUV's front end. The impact cuts the T-3 in half. The horn blares, and smoke rises from the damaged hood.

"Oh..." Kimberly grabs her head as she stumbles out of the SUV. She holds a Glock.

I rush over to her. "Are you okay?"

Kimberly acts like she's a little dizzy as she glances back at the wreckage. I help her away from the vehicle as she tells me, "Remind me never to do that again."

Kimberly's view...

"You rescued me," that woman says as if she's astonished I could do such a thing.

"I guess I did–" I say also astonished that I did come back for her. I do still need her. I can't let her die just yet. I look behind us as the two T-3s rise to their feet. "–but we're not safe yet."

One of the T-3s raises its gun, and I lift the Glock and fire, missing the T-3. The bullet strikes the SUV's gas tank and blows up the vehicle, and the explosion knocks us both down.

Katharine's view...

I'm dazed by the explosion and moan as I lift my head. Smoke and dust cling to my lungs along with the smell of gas and my ears are ringing. None of the T-3s are moving. I look at Kimberly, and I'm relieved to see her stir. We're both bruised and battered.

"There they are!" a man with light brown skin and a black goatee shouts. He and six other S.C.Ms. in jet-black uniforms rush down the ramp. They train their assault rifles on us as the one man orders, "Don't move!"

I look at the men's shoulder patch with the Sphinx Corporation Emblem. The Third Branch Office Crest, a gold olive tree with three branches, is above the emblem. "Kimberly, we have to run," I whisper, too weak to stand. "We're not safe yet."

The man kneels beside us and tells us, "Don't move. You could be injured." He glances around Sub-level One and looks back to us. "I'm Lieutenant Creed. Ms. Griffin, your father sent us in to retrieve you."

"My father?" Kimberly repeats as she stares up into his face.

"Yes." Creed motions for his men to fan out and secure the area.

I relax and allow myself to rest. We did it. We survived the Factory.

"The T-3s are disabled," one of his men reports.

"Let's get these two out of here," Creed commands. "We'll take them to one of the Sphinx Corporation's medical facilities." He turns his attention to us. "Don't worry. You're safe now."
Chapter Forty-eight

Safe At Last?

October 21...

Thursday...

10:02 A.M...

Katharine's view...

The next day at Main One Hospital, I cautiously make my way down a hall. My left hand's fisted around an object, protecting my most precious possession. I had earlier awoken in a bed with a nurse by my side and Kimberly nowhere in sight. I'm looking for her to make sure that nothing has happened to my new partner. The building smells antiseptic, but more than that, it feels suffocating like a prison. My body's sore and bruised, and it complains all the way as I shuffle my feet in the slippers the hospital provided. The after-effects of the Ultra-Epi give me a slight headache and make me skittish, but at least the side effects are mild for now. I pause at a large window, look out at the darkness, and see that we're on the fourth floor surrounded by mega-buildings. Two nurses walk by, pulling me from my thoughts, and I glance at what I clasp. I need to find Kimberly, but I also wish I knew where we were. I turn back to the window and study the shape of the surrounding mega-buildings. I think we're back in the Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage.

At least that's one good thing, we're only a few vicinages away from home. I chuckle. I just called Kimberly's apartment my home. She'd definitely argue that point. She sees me more as an intruder than a roommate.

I turn and continue down the hall, thinking back to the Factory. The men who rescued us work for the Sphinx Corporation just like the Council, so why did they save us? Why am I not a prisoner of the Council? Why... has become my favorite word.

I look at my balled hand and quicken my pace. I have to find Kimberly. After a few minutes, I find her room, and Kimberly's awake and sitting up in bed. I go in and stand by her bed. I've already forgotten my earlier comment to myself and whisper, "I want to go home." I add, "I don't like it here. We should go."

Kimberly's view...

I'm wearing a hospital gown and robe, and I'm actually relaxing. It has been a while.

I glance up from the Conglomerate World Magazine. Surely that woman isn't calling my place home. She better not get too comfortable. Does that woman really think she's some sort of guest?

I return to my reading and state, "Relax, we're safe here. Anyway–" I scan an article on Corporate Bodyguards. "–you probably opened a few stitches on your bullet wound. It would be better–" I flip a few pages forward to a story on Topa. "–if we stayed here a few days." I turn to the last story, mumble a few words from a paragraph about the Chairman of the Sphinx Corporation, and tell her, "My father's flipping the bill."

Katharine's view...

I put a hand on my shoulder. "Actually, my wound is... it's..." I fidget over my words as much as my feet do as I try to stand in place. "That's one thing I need to tell you. You see–"

"Go back to your room and rest and let me rest. Main One is one of the finest hospitals in Noir." Kimberly lifts the magazine higher, completely eliminating me from view and continues the last article. "Everything will be all–"

I blurt, "I don't like this place and–"

"For Ares' sake!" Kimberly smacks the magazine on her lap. "And what?"

I move closer and whisper, "They took the Data Crystal."

"They did what?" Kimberly throws her blankets to the side and sits on the edge of the bed.

"It's gone," I whisper. "Someone took it from my clothes."

She stands and opens the cabinet where they placed her things. "What about the music box?"

"I still have it. I kept it in my hand the whole time." I keep glancing over my shoulder, expecting security to barge in and arrest us.

Kimberly's view...

"Hades!" I yell after going through my clothing and knapsack. "The disk is gone. The one the Ro..." I stop myself from saying the Rogue. No need to bring up bad memories and remind that woman what I did to her. "The disk I found in Computer Lab Two." I slam my palm on the cabinet door. "They took it!"

"I want to..." that woman starts and pauses as two nurses walk by. "I want to go back to the apartment. I don't like it here; it reminds me of the Factory."

I walk over to my bed and press the call button.

"What are you doing?" she asks.

I feel my face flush with anger as I tell her, "I'm ringing a nurse, so I can ask them which one of them is a thief!"

"Kimberly, this hospital belongs to the Sphinx Corporation." She moves to my side and continues, "The Factory is part of them. Sphinx wants to keep whatever secrets are on the disk for themselves, so no one here will help you."

A nurse walks into the room. "Is there something you need, Ms. Griffin?"

I snap, "Yes, we're checking ourselves out."

"I don't think that's such a good–"

I interrupt the nurse, "Do you know whose daughter I am?"

"Yes," the nurse replies.

"Well then..." I put a hand on my hip. "Get the paperwork moving."

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office...

The Chairman's office...

The secretary's voice spoke over the intercom, "Mr. Griffin, Orthos is here."

He told her, "Cathy, show him in."

Within a few minutes, the secretary opened the door, and Orthos entered.

"Will you be needing anything, Mr. Griffin?" she questioned as she stood by the door.

"No, Cathy, that will be all."

The secretary left.

Orthos said, "I have received some intel from the Factory." He paused, unsure how to proceed, and continued, "Your daughter discovered a disk that was stolen from your office five years ago."

"What do we have to worry about? As you said, the data is at least five years old."

Orthos paused again and relayed, "That particular disk had termination orders for one Theresa Griffin signed by Janus."

Mr. Griffin scowled. "It will only become a problem if Kimberly discovers that's my a.k.a. I have not gone by that name since my promotion from Head of Security for the Third Branch Office, and Kimberly has never heard me referred by it." He leaned forward, resting on his elbows. "To be on the safe side, make sure all records relating to Janus are expunged and retrieve that disk."

"I already have the disk in my possession." Orthos laid the jewel case on the desk.

Mr. Griffin noticed the dried blood and panicked. "Is that Kimberly's–"

"Your daughter is bruised but unharmed so do not worry. Lieutenant Creed's men were able to extract them from the Factory."

"Well done. Did my daughter or the stray have anything else in their possession?"

"No, sir."

"See to the Janus records."

"Right away, sir," Orthos said and then added, "You do understand I cannot erase any of the records at the Second or Main Branch Office."

"Yes, I understand. Let's hope Kimberly doesn't stumble across any more information pertaining to her mother." He paused and added, "That is all."

Mr. Griffin faced the picture of his wife after Orthos left. He didn't understand why she had to go against Sphinx. She also made him choose between her and his work. Mr. Griffin picked up the picture frame and gently stroked Theresa's face. He hoped his daughter didn't force him to make the same decision.

Outside in the hall...

Orthos passed the secretary and entered the elevator and once the doors closed, he reached into his coat pocket and removed the Data Crystal he'd taken from Kat. He hated lying to the Chairman, but he did have his own promotion to think about, and he couldn't gain anything if he gave away his resources. Orthos examined the two-inch white obelisk.

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Asclepius Hospital...

Maxwell stood by a large window, examining the new day enveloped by night. The bald tech had a bandage on his right elbow and one on his chin. The nurses at Asclepius Hospital treated him and his partner very well. Peters sat in a chair beside Argus' bed as the operative rested. Peters' wrist was bandaged.

Dr. Brian Chiron walked in and reviewed Argus' chart. "You had a run in with those... What do they call them?"

"Bio-mechas," Peters spoke up.

Brian put the chart back. "You guys are lucky to be alive." He walked over to Argus and checked his vitals. "Those machines have killed a lot of people."

"Don't we know it." Maxwell made his way to the bed. "How's he doing?"

"Fine, considering they beat him up pretty badly. There was a slight infection from the bullet; it had been in his leg for a long time. I removed it with no problems, and the meds are taking care of the rest. He should be fine." Brian started out. "I'll check on him again in about half an hour." He left.

Maxwell picked up a remote and turned on the TV. The NBS news was on, and Linda Harvey was in the middle of a story.

"At this time, it is still unclear which corporation was behind the bio-mecha attacks that happened earlier this week. N.C.P.F. have confirmed that all these robotic men have been eliminated and that they are no longer a threat to Noir citizens." She turned to a new camera. "In other news, an upset in the Corporate Senate. The quarter-cent sales tax raise was not voted through. Analysts are–"

"I hate the news," Maxwell muttered and turned it off.

Peters questioned his partner, "What do we do now?"

"Hmm... What do you mean?" Maxwell asked.

"What are we going to do now that the Factory's gone?"

"That is easy," a man answered.

Both techs turned.

The man wore a black suit and stood in the doorway. "You're going to come work for us."

Five S.C.Ms. rushed in, and a doctor and a nurse came in with them. The doctor and nurse moved to Argus' bed and unhooked him from the machines.

"What are you doing?" Maxwell asked.

"The Counsel wishes for Argus to return home," the man in the black suit answered. "Don't worry, the Sanctum has the best medical facility in Noir. He's in excellent hands, but we were talking about you two." The man removed two envelopes and then handed one to Maxwell and one to Peters. "Here are the Council's offers for you two to come work for them."

"We can't," Maxwell spoke up. "We signed a non-discloser–"

"Yes, we know about that agreement. If you would look at the other papers in the envelopes, you will discover a document stating we have acquired all information and technology from the Factory and as some of the surviving employees, we would like you two to come and work for us. You can have your lawyers look over the contracts before you agree."

"Maxwell, they're offering twice what we were making."

"Yeah, I see."

"What do you think?" Peters asked.

"If the lawyers clear it, I say we take the man's offer."

"I'm with you," Peters replied. "Looks like we won't be out of work."
Chapter Fifty

Ms. Melissa Odin

10:34 A.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

A gold limo drove down the busy Brownstone Street in front of the Bes Hotel, and a Corporate Emblem of a golden triangle marked the front doors and hood. The vehicle came to a halt, the chauffeur got out, and walked to the back. The driver put one hand behind his back and opened the door. A thin man with a shaven head stepped to the sidewalk. He wore a light blue business suit with white stripes, and the suit resembled a pharaoh's headdress. The man dreaded the job that lay before him. He stood tall almost seven-foot and wore Kohl, a black eyeliner. He also had a small ponytail on the right side of his shaved head.

"Find someplace to park," the man told the driver. "I will call you when I'm done."

The chauffeur nodded, "Yes, Mr. Serbet." The driver went back to the vehicle and soon pulled away.

Mr. Serbet made his way to a stoop and rang a doorbell of a two-story brownstone, and a security camera mounted on the wall above him turned to get a better view.

A man spoke through an intercom, "Can I help you?"

"I am Mr. Serbet. I am from the Isis Corporation. I am here to see Ms. Melissa Odin."

"Can I see some ID?"

"Of course." Mr. Serbet removed a wallet and lifted the photo ID to the camera.

A device on the camera scanned the identification bar code and transmitted the information to an H.H.C. the man inside held. "Thank you," the man said. "Please wait one moment."

A few minutes earlier...

Inside the two-story house...

Melissa stared at a notebook, looking over formula equations. She wore a light gray dress with a flower pattern. She shook her head. Everything she was going through was because of these formulas. About six days ago, Melissa converted the empty room into a home lab. Several beakers on a large table had a yellowish substance in them, and a few racks of test tubes sat beside a microscope. Someone knocked, and she looked up.

"Yes?"

A man opened the door.

"Daniels, what is it?" Melissa asked the bodyguard.

"There is a Mr. Serbet from the Isis Corporation at the door. Should I let him in?"

"He's from the Isis Corporation? I wasn't expecting anyone today. Let him in and bring him here."

The bodyguard left and soon returned with the man from the corporation.

Melissa stood, walked over to the man, and shook his hand as she said, "Hello, Mr. Serbet."

The man bowed his head in greeting. "Ms. Odin."

She turned to the bodyguard. "Thank you, Daniels. Please go check on the children."

"Yes, Ms. Odin." The bodyguard exited.

Melissa motioned to a chair. "Please have a seat." She sat in another chair. "Is there any word on my case? Will my old employer, the Valhalla Corporation, take me to court?"

"Valhalla is taking you to court over your contract with them. Your lawyers from Isis were able to excuse you from appearing. The judge agreed Valhalla might decide to hire a Life Closer to kill you before the matter's settled in court. It's a good thing we placed you and the children in this safe house. Two more bodyguards will be showing up shortly." He crossed his legs. "Is there anything you need?"

"No, this house has everything we need." She stood. "Would you like some coffee?"

"Actually, Ms. Odin..." He also stood. "There's another matter I must tell you; it's the reason I came in person."

"Oh... What is that?"

He motioned to her chair. "Maybe you should sit back down."

"Why would I..?" she started to ask and then questioned, "What has happened?"

"It's about your brother, Norman." Mr. Serbet wasn't sure how to tell her and decided to come right out with it. "He's dead."

She fell back, caught herself on the table, and knocked over the rack of test tubes, and the yellowish substance spilled. A few of the glass containers fell to the tile floor and broke, shattering into pieces. Mr. Serbet quickly moved to her and helped her to the chair and after a few moments of shock, Melissa put a hand to her mouth as tears streamed down her face. "How did it happen? Was it a Closer?"

"Yes."

She gasped.

Daniels burst in with his gun drawn. "Ms. Odin! Are you all right?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Please, put your gun away." The bodyguard still looked a little worried, so Melissa added, "Really, everything's fine."

Mr. Serbet turned to the bodyguard. "Ms. Odin received some unsettling news about her brother."

"I see." Daniels didn't know what to say and holstered his weapon. "I'll be in the living room if you need anything, Ms. Odin."

Melissa sniffed. "Thank you, Daniels."

The bodyguard left.

Ms. Odin turned to Mr. Serbet. "Tell me about this Closer. Does this have anything to do with my court case?"

"No, we believe it has nothing to do with your current problems with Valhalla. The Closer was an illegal one hired by a man named Topa. Topa works for Valhalla but went out on his own to hire the Illicit Closer." He handed her a handkerchief.

Melissa wiped her eyes, blew her nose, and then asked, "Has Topa been arrested?"

Mr. Serbet shook his head. "No, an assassin named the Phoenix closed him."

"Do you know why Topa wanted my brother killed?"

"Your brother, Norman, a.k.a. Preacher disrupted sales of Sunna Snapps on Wayfaring Lane, and that's why Topa had him killed. Valhalla Corporation had him testing the drug there."

Melissa's view...

It's because of Sunna Snapps. No, it can't be, not the drug I created.

I look at my notebook, then to the yellowish substance, and say, "If that is all Mr. Serbet, I could use some time to myself."

"Of course." He heads for the door. "I'll show myself out."

After he leaves, I lay my head on the table. It's my fault. It's all my fault that my brother is dead. I weep as I say, "Please forgive me, Norman. I'll never forgive myself."
Chapter Fifty-one

Returning Home

12:18 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Tainted Rain poured on West 1000 Avenue, covering the street with oily black water, and the six-wheeled automated Street Sanitizers paused from their work and shut down everything but their parking lights. They allowed Noir's drainage system to take care of the rain. The Sanitizers' work would come again when the storm passed.

Frustrated over the loss of the Disk and Data Crystal, Kim and Kat sat in the back of a limo that had picked them up from the Main One Hospital. Mr. Griffin sent the driver to take the women back to the Nexus Apartments. The limo passed several of the dormant street cleaners as the vehicle traveled through the Residential Vicinage. Several apartments and restaurants lined West 1000 Avenue. Many of the people that walked the dark sidewalks lit by street lights had umbrellas and/or were dressed in raincoats and even a few wore Winnow Masks. Some people rushed to have lunch before their break hour ended, and many more vehicles roared up and down the road, spraying the Tainted Rain on the sidewalks.

Katharine's view...

We're both in the limo as I stare at my shoulder. I should have told Kimberly while we were at the hospital, but I never found the right moment. I roll my eyes, remembering back. I never had a chance with Kimberly yelling so much. And she was mostly yelling at me like it was my fault they took the disk from her. I wonder if I should tell her now. Maybe if I want to get yelled at again.

"Hades!" Kimberly bellows for the tenth time. "I should have known better! For Ares' sake! I can't believe I stayed in bed while they robbed us." She folds her arms. "Who is behind this? How did they know I had the disk or that you had the crystal?"

I don't reply. I have no answers. I watch the city go by, deciding I'll wait a little longer. Kimberly's too mad, and what I have to tell her will be hard enough without staring into her angry gaze. She may look at me differently once I've told her the unsettling news, and I don't know if I can take that. I finally have someone who's on my side.

Kimberly's view...

"I'll track them down," I vow as I sit next to that woman. "And when I find them..." I squeeze my knapsack that's on my lap. "They'll wish–"

"I think we need some tea," that woman interrupts still staring out the window. "It will calm us and clear our minds." She glances at her shoulder. "A lot has happened today, and we have a lot to think about and maybe even talk about."

"Tea?" I turn to her as she faces me, and I ask, "Is tea your answer to everything?"

"No, it's just..."

I'm beaten for the moment, so I let out a long breath and say, "It's just that we can't do anything else right now, so why not? Fine, we'll have some tea."

The limo pulls into Nexus Apartment's parking garage and drops us off and after some time, the two of us sip on hot lemon zinger in silence as we sit in the living room on the couch.

I think over everything that's happened to us, and I finally break the quiet and say, "Please tell me you downloaded the information from the Data Crystal to the music box."

"Yes, I think so." She retrieves it from her backpack, places the music box in her palm, and commands, "Theresa."

The hologram materializes and examines the room. Whenever I see her image, I'm so happy and yet so heartbroken at the same time.

"Where are we? I don't recognize this place."

"It's my apartment," I answer.

"It is very nice. I take it the Un-Men are no longer hunting the two of you."

"We're safe," that woman answers as she places the music box on the coffee table. "What information did the Data Crystal contain?"

"The files were locked," the hologram replies. "I am working on breaking the encryption, and it may take me some time." She adds, "There was one file entitled the Gorgons with no encryption; it only contained an address."

I retrieve my laptop from the master bedroom and log onto the internet. I type the address in a map locator search box and within seconds, the results pop up. "This place is in the Hellenistic Sector." I study the cross streets. "I haven't been to this part of the sector. We'll have to check it out."

Katharine's view...

I'm so exhausted, so I plead, "Tomorrow." I want to take some time and play Unfinished Melody and regain more of my strength. I can function at this point, but I'm a little on edge. I tell Kimberly, "It'll still be there tomorrow."

She says, "I want to go now. There are probably clues there but... I do have to think about my new partner. If you collapse, I'll have to lug your body around." Kimberly closes her laptop and adds, "We better both rest. I imagine your shoulder is killing you after all the stress you put it through."

"My shoulder?" I put a hand to it as butterflies flutter all around my stomach and keep bumping into the walls, giving me a bellyache. "Actually–"

Kimberly's thoughts seem to be elsewhere as she interrupts me, "Tomorrow then." She stands and grabs her laptop. "I'll be in my room."

I watch her leave as the number of butterflies in my stomach double.

Kimberly's view...

I go into the master bedroom, lock the door, sit at my desk, open my email on the laptop, and type, "Voice, Phoenix here." I wait and receive an instant message from the Regulator of the Assassins League.

"Has your problem been taken care of?"

I glance at the door, think of that woman, and type, "Yes, the problem has been taken care of."

"Are you sure?" Voice types back. "I would hate for this to come back to you if the problem hasn't been taken care of."

Does Voice know? No, Voice doesn't know who I am, so Voice can't have me under surveillance. Why does Voice doubt my answer? I've never lied in the past.

I type, "The problem is gone like I said. Do you doubt my word?"

"No, of course not. I only wanted to make sure for my own piece of mind. Since the Closing in Moscow, well... this latest event concerned me that is all."

I stare at the screen, wonder how to respond, and type, "I contacted you to inform you I'm taking a hiatus as you and my father suggested." I press the send button and wait.

A few minutes pass, and an instant message beeps on the screen. "I have an assignment I was hoping you would do for me. It's local. It is a rooftop Closing. Would you mind taking one more assignment before starting your break? It won't take more than a day or two. I'll owe you one."

I stare at the screen. I can't say no to Voice, so I reply, "Send me the file, and I'll take care of it for you."

"I will have the file sent to you tomorrow. Enjoy the repose. Voice signing off."

Great... Just great! I have no idea what I'll do with that woman while I'm on the Closing. I can't say, 'Hey, I'm going to kill someone, want to come along? It could be fun.' I stretch my arms. I'll have to think of something. The laptop goes to the screensaver of the flaming Phoenix as I stand and leave.

I walk through the hall and shout, "I'm hungry. Want to order a pizza?" I turn the corner and find the apartment's empty. Now, where did she go?
Chapter Fifty-two

Ginn L. Irynkissgthie

12:23 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

Outside the Factory...

Lieutenant Creed flipped down his night vision goggles and scanned the large field of grassy weeds inside the perimeter. All was quiet in the green hue except for a breeze sweeping across the tall blades. He nodded to his men, and they retreated from the Factory's main gate and in the distance, they heard engines rumble to life. The S.C.Ms. knew this time would come, and they tensed.

He touched his headset. "Creed, here. Reporting in." He looked at the road leading to the Factory and then to an H.H.C. he held, and the screen showed many blips coming their way. "Alpha and the T-3s are moving out. We have backed away from the gate as ordered. Are you sure you don't want me to engage?" Creed listened. "Yes. Yes. Understood, sir. We won't hinder the T-3s retreat from the Factory." He examined the long line of cars and trucks making their way to the main gate, and he noticed a few of the vehicles showed scorched marks and a couple hobbled out on a flat tire or two. "Will secure the Factory once they leave."

Creed and his men glared at the T-3s as they left. They lost a lot of good soldiers to them.

"One day, you will pay," Creed vowed, gripping his weapon. "And I'll be there. I'll be there to witness your end."

* * *

Deep inside the Factory...

The Rogue realized it hadn't run into one single T-3 as it made its way back to Research Lab Five. Alpha must have fled with its minions. The Rogue passed the long-forgotten room of science equipment and entered the chamber filled with statues and with the accent lights still down because of Pandora's EFP, the Rogue activated its night vision.

The Rogue's view...

What about Pandora? Is she dead or did she escape? I hold my wounded shoulder. Why did she not destroy me? I have to know. I make a face as if in agony, and then I look at the life-size statues. I try to figure out why I came back here. I know it is not to look for Pandora. She will not return here.

All the Ginns point to a wall in the back of the room, and I make my way to it and stare at the tiled surface. I scan the area, probe the wall with my infrared, and find nothing out of the ordinary temperature wise. I remove my ORATT from my suit pocket, put them on, and switch to through-wall radar on my polarized spectacles. There is a hall on the other side. I feel along the wall with my good hand till I find a marble tile slightly sticking out and press it, and the wall slides up, rumbling as the ceiling swallows it.

Once the dust settles, I start down the long descending hall and with every few steps I take, a light comes on, lighting the way. After about fifteen minutes, the hall ends at a room, and I pause at the doorway as several lights blink on inside and light up the center where two black stones sit on a raised platform. I make my way to the four-foot cubed stones with white writing. I come to this hidden room driven by some unknown force, so I need to find out what is important about the two stones. I smooth my palm over the right one's engraved letters. Will they tell me why Pandora didn't destroy me?

I read the one.

Though the clouds darken the sun,

and the rain becomes tainted,

always know there will be

a love that will not die.

Though hope seems a distant memory,

and human machines walk the land,

know no one can destroy

a love that will not die.

The One constant,

the One unchanging,

the One love.

Put your faith in

the love that will not die.

This is intriguing. This is what Pandora was reciting after I choked her into unconsciousness. I examine the stones, and it looks like both of the pieces are part of a larger one, but do both of them belong to the same stone?

I walk around them, decide I will investigate that matter later, and read the other block.

The land has darkened,

hope has fled,

and greed rules.

Finish it!

Call forth the Rushlight.

Open the pathway between.

Bring an end to false gods.

Bring an end to lies,

so usher in the Rushlight,

creature of the void

and Destroyer of...

The rest of the stone has been destroyed, and the writing is missing. Ginn L. Irynkissgthie, are these about Pandora? Is she the Rushlight, and what is she the destroyer of? I put my hand on the stone. Why did I come here? If my purpose is to destroy Pandora, why did I come to this place? The stones tell me of no way to destroy her. Unless I am not supposed to destroy her. What is it she once said?

I replay the event in my computer's eye. Pandora said she does not want me dead. She just wants me to stop hunting her. She told me maybe my creators are afraid of me, not because I have feelings, but because I have the potential to disobey my programming.

I pull from the memory. Is that it? Can I disobey my programming? Have I evolved to the next level? I consider it for a moment. Pandora did not want me dead. She said as much, so why do I need to hunt her? I look at the stones and decide I have to know more about the Rushlight and these blocks. I have to find the answers to my questions and now that I have a new purpose, I will stop hunting her. I will see if I have more of a purpose than killing, and I will discover the secrets of Pandora.

12:34 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Up on the Nexus Apartments' rooftop...

Katharine's view...

I feel bad because I've kept a secret from Kimberly; it's a small one, but it's still a secret. I need to be open with my new partner, and how can I do that if I keep things from her? Even if I'm afraid to tell her, I still should. The Tainted Rain ended a short time before I came up to the roof. I grip the railing, glance at my shoulder, and let my thoughts drift away as I dread the task before me. I stare down at the road, watching the Street Sanitizers at work. Several of the robotic cleaners rumble across the avenue and for a few minutes, they distract me from my fears.

I start to count them. In Wayfaring Lane, I thought there might've been four or five, but here... I count more than a dozen just in this area. A few more minutes pass, and I lean back as I hold onto the railing and let freedom blow over me. I can't remember a time when I didn't have to worry about the Un-Men finding me. I'm safe, safe to worry about other things, so I study the star on my palm. More and more mysteries pop up with no answers like this thing. I rub my fingers over the red scar, and the burn no longer hurts. The mark opened the door to the Gallery with some sort of microscopic cipher imprinted on the star and that same star is on the music box. I place my hand back to the railing and lean on the metal. I asked the hologram if she knew what they were, but she didn't know. I stare at the sky, feeling as gloomy as it looks, then the door to the rooftop opens, and Kimberly steps out.

"So this is where you went," Kimberly states as she walks over to me. "What are you doing up here?" She looks down at my feet. "At least you remembered shoes."

"There's something I've been meaning to tell you..." I pause, not sure how to explain, then turn my attention back down to the street.

Kimberly's view...

"Well, what is it?" I question, glancing at her.

Is that woman thinking about what the Rogue said? Is she wondering if she's organic-mecha? I am, and I've been wondering if she knew this fact all along. Could the Guild or the Council that woman keeps mentioning be testing me for some reason?

I also stare down at the street. What if that woman is organic-mecha? What if she found me for some other reason than what she claims? Whatever I do, I can't let that woman know that I'm thinking this way.

I ask, "It's not that thing the Rogue told you, is it? I wouldn't worry. There's no way you're one of those organic-mechas." I lightly smack her on the left arm and laugh to give her a sense that it doesn't bother me. I want her to think that I don't believe the possible truth. "You're too weird to be something programmed."

Katharine's view...

"Thanks, I think, but it's not that," I tell her as I grip my shoulder, wondering what Kimberly will think of me once she does find out. "It's..." I start, take a deep breath to continue, but then I chicken out and walk away from the ledge. Our partnership is so fragile... My secret might just shatter it, and a fear of abandonment sweeps over me, chilling me with an arctic blast of doubt and cowardice.

A realization comes to me... Have I already come to rely on Kimberly? I barely know her and yet I feel as though I do. I'm so afraid of what she'll think of me that I decide against revealing my secret. I don't know if I can handle her looking at me any different because something's not right with me.

I give in to my anxieties and tell her, "Never mind."

"Don't do that," she snaps. "Don't start something and not finish it." She moves closer to me like we've been friends forever, and she's deeply concerned for me. "Tell me what it is. Remember we're partners, and we're supposed to trust each other."

I'm not sure what to do now. I want to forget about it, but Kimberly already knows something's wrong. I want to trust someone again like I did with Preacher. I'm just afraid I'll be betrayed like I have been by others. I'm afraid Kimberly will betray me again like she did when she handed me over to the Rogue.

"I'm not sure how to say it," I admit as those fears keep me from coming out and telling her the truth. I direct our conversation elsewhere by saying, "The past year I've learned that I'm the Pandora Project." My heart fills with dread, knowing what my experiment name means. "You told me Pandora was the woman who doomed the world."

Kimberly answers, "Yes, I told you that Pandora let all good escape from existence. She had released it from a box."

"Is that my destiny?" I ask her. "I'm afraid I was created, programmed, or conditioned to destroy."

Kimberly's view...

That woman is so pathetic. I came all the way up here and all she's worried about is the name the Council gave her. I feel like pulling out my gun and shooting her. Good thing I didn't bring it with me.

This thing about her name is bothering her, act or not, and I decide I need to continue my own part as the supportive partner. I still need her for a while, and I can't have her moping around.

"You've got to be kidding. This is what you're worried about?" I start out. "Come on, there are more things to fear than–"

"Are there?" she interrupts me. "Then why call me Pandora if not to mean doom?"

I stand there gazing at her, not knowing what to say. If this is an act, she's good, but what if it's not? What if that woman truly believes she's to doom the world? I scowl. I can't have her thinking that way. She'll be no use to me.

I say, "There's one thing I didn't tell you. There's more to the story. You see, Pandora managed to keep hope in the box. She managed to keep hope in the world."

"Hope?"

"Yes, hope," I answer, and then I tell her to give that woman a false sense of possibility, "Maybe your destiny isn't to bring doom but hope. Now..." I move for the door. "If we're done up here, let's go inside and order a pizza." I start in. "I'm starved."

Katharine's view...

"Kimberly..." I call after her still afraid of exposing my secret.

She turns around and states, "Like I said, what could be so–"

I blurt out, "My wound... It's gone. There's no trace that I was ever shot."

"What? That's impossible!" Kimberly exclaims as she walks back over to me, and then she demands, "Show me."

I unzip my jacket, pull the collar of my t-shirt to the side, and show her my unbandaged shoulder. I tense, not knowing how she'll react. Please don't think I'm a freak... Please don't end our partnership and kick me out of the apartment.

She examines my shoulder as she says, "Hades... It is gone, but that's impossible. When did it happen?"

"I don't know," I reply as I can't tell what she's thinking. Does she see me as a freak? Is she mentally recoiling from me in disgust?

I add, "It was like this when I awoke at Main One Hospital."

Kimberly's view...

"This is what you're worried about?" I chuckle. "Come on." I put my hand on her shoulder, reassuring her, "With all the technology the corporations have, this isn't out of the ordinary, so don't worry." I force a smile. "Come on, let's go order that pizza."

That woman believes I'm not repulsed by her freakishness, and her face brightens as she questions me, "Can we get a Coke to go with it?"

"Coke? I've never heard of it, but I'll ask, and if they don't have it, we'll get a Crite."

She runs ahead of me like some child at an amusement park who can't wait to get on a ride. I follow that strange woman back in, and we go to the elevator. I press button 31, and we make our way down. I stand behind her and stare at her back, wondering what kind of monstrosity lurks inside that woman. I need to be more cautious of her than before, and I need to reconsider this partnership. Robot or mutant... I can't trust her.

Later, we enter Apartment H, and I head to my room as she sits on the couch and turns on the news. I go and sit on my bed and open the drawer of my nightstand and inside lies the marked bullet. For now, I need to keep that woman around. Whether organic-mecha or wayward soul, she could still be of some use to me. I chuckle to myself again. If I want to return to work, I'll have to get rid of her. I remove the 9 mm round and decide I'll keep the bullet with me from now on. I place Pale Horse in the small zipper compartment of my zipped up hoodie. That woman did see my face, and I can't let anyone live who knows I'm the Phoenix.

In the living room...

Katharine's view...

Kimberly seems to have accepted me as I am, but what about what the Rogue said to me? I clutch a pillow, paying no attention to the TV. Am I organic-mecha? Am I some sort of freak? I dig my nails into the pillow. What if I am? What if there's no past for me to find? What then? I glance at the hall. What about my partnership with Kimberly? Will I be able to depend on her or will she kill me when she no longer needs me? I bury my face in the pillow. What does the future hold for me?

Kimberly's view...

I enter the kitchen and glance at the small round table. Nine days ago I sat there, sulking over my pathetic life. I wished that I wasn't alone, that I had more in this life, and that there would be someone there for me. Now I have more to look forward to like taking my revenge. I walk over to the cupboard and grab a glass. As for my wish... I look at that woman sitting on the couch. I need to be more careful about what I ask for.

She turns to me with a serious expression on her face and when she sees the glass, her face brightens as she questions, "Fixing more tea?"

I'm amused by her simple-mindedness. She is addicted to tea and for some reason, I want to give her a least a little hospitality before I'm done with her, so I answer, "Sure we can have more tea, put the kettle on and set the table. Make yourself useful." I place the glass back in the cupboard and grab two teacups. "The pizza won't be here for about forty-five minutes."

That woman turns the TV off and comes into the kitchen.

Sometime later...

Lifting her cup, that woman toasts, "Here's to our partnership. May it be successful."

I clink my cup to hers. "I'll drink to that. To a successful future, wherever it takes us."

Yes... May I be successful in finding who murdered my mom.

The Star Binds Them

12:40 P.M...

The Chamber...

Mr. Decuma pulled up new bio-data on his laptop. "The Cerberus Project has gone above our expectations. This experiment has surpassed the old project."

"I do not know about that," Mr. Morta stated. "We were unable to activate Pandora's potential."

Mr. Decuma uttered, "As I thought, one of us has taken a liking to the wayward project."

Mr. Morta said, "It is not like that."

"What is it like?" Mr. Decuma asked.

"I believe Pandora is the superior design. We are the ones who failed for not providing a sufficient catalyst. We should have done more."

Appalled by his reply, Ms. Nona questioned, "Our fault?"

"Yes," Mr. Morta answered. "Maybe we should have told Pandora about its past, and then Pandora would not have been so driven to search for the missing pieces."

A male supervisor handed Ms. Nona a report. "There seems to be a problem with our acquisition of the Factory's assets. There is one Research Outpost in Antarctica, Vulcan Station, that the T-3s did not attack. If the Sphinx Corporation Main Office finds out part of the Factory has survived, we will have to turn over everything we acquired from the Factory to Vulcan Station."

Mr. Morta stated, "The situation could be a test for Cerberus. The new project can close the outpost for us, and we can see how Cerberus reacts with the human element."

"A fine idea," Ms. Nona said as she curled up her thin cherry-red lips in a grin.

"I agree," Mr. Decuma replied.

"It is settled then," Mr. Morta said. "We will send Cerberus to Antarctica."

7:01 P.M...

No setting sun declared the approach of night, and all was black. Darkness lingered, but a glimmer of hope existed. Zax turned his van down an alley beside Dad's Donuts, activated a garage door, and pulled into the Maydag Auto Garage and within, the place was quiet. All the mechanics had gone home for the day. Zax parked, went to the second storage room, unlocked the door with a key, and went in. Broken equipment and tools along with used oil and other discards filled the cobwebbed shelves, and the place smelled of dust and gas. Zax went to the back wall, looked up at an unlit light, half unscrewed the bulb from the socket, and pulled the chain. The back wall flipped around a hundred and eighty degrees and on the other side, Zax walked along a gray stone passage to a metal door with no knob. Beside the door were a camera and an intercom.

"Identify yourself," a man's voice commanded.

Zax looked up into the lens. "Delivery Man." He waited a few seconds and added, "R.G. wanted to see me."

The door slid open, and Zax proceeded halfway down a white-tiled hall to a glass-enclosed security desk and there, three men and a woman monitored security screens. All four were armed, and one of the men waved him up to a bio-detector. Zax went and stood in the device as the man scanned him for life signs.

"Oh, what's this?" the security officer uttered. "Do I detect a bio-mecha?"

Zax started to answer, "I'm not–"

The security officer interrupted, "Nope, all human. Delivery Man isn't an Un-Man today. You may proceed."

Zax mockingly laughed at the snide remark and continued down the hall. The passage ended at a door, and he opened it and entered a dark room. Its center was lit by one single light, and he went and stood in it. Zax waited a few minutes in silence.

A mechanically altered voice of R.G. spoke over an intercom. "Delivery Man, were you able to retrieve the scans I requested?"

"Yes." Zax cleared his throat. "The two conveniently ordered a pizza, and I was able to intercept the delivery boy and exchange the pizza box with one of mine. Ms. Griffin took the box from the delivery boy and the hidden scanner picked up her Star Cipher."

"Yes, I know of that one. What of the other?"

He answered, "There was none on her left hand, but there is a Star Cipher on Katharine's left."

"That's most interesting. What does it mean to have two bear the Stars instead of one?" R.G. paused. "They don't know it yet, but the Stars bind them to a destiny, one I will make sure they fulfill."

"What kind of destiny?" Zax asked.

"One I'll tell you in due time. Good work. Continue to monitor the two. I'm most interested in how they will work together and what they will accomplish. There's so much for them to do." R.G. paused and asked, "Did you discover anything else?"

"Yes, before they threw the box away I was able to overhear some of their conversation. Kimberly's looking for who killed her mom."

R.G.'s view...

This is most interesting. Did someone tell her or did Kimberly remember the fiery incident on her own?

I ask, "Anything else?"

"One other thing, Katharine has lost her memory. She doesn't remember anything past a year ago."

"I was afraid of that," I state and order, "Set up a surveillance of their residence. I must know more."

Zax's view...

"Understood, I'll get on it right away."

I leave as I consider how the Stars might bind the two to a destiny. Is this a destiny that will help Noir and destroy the Dry Clouds or is there something R.G. is hiding from me?
Chapter Fifty-five

Arrival at Vulcan Station

9:12 P.M...

At the bottom of the world...

The Vulcan Station resided near the South Geomagnetic Pole at the center of the East Antarctic ice sheet, and it was also located five miles away from where the Dry Clouds' Curtain ended south. A helicopter flew over the icy land of white and blue, racing a coming snowstorm.

A Council S.C.M. pilot talked to his three passengers on their headsets. "E.T.A. five minutes and once we land, make sure to take everything with you. I'll be lifting off once you've clear the landing pad and won't be back till this storm clears. It could take me a few more days to return for you. You'll have to stay longer than what you planned." He glanced at the younger of the two men. "Make sure you accomplish your task by then."

The passengers nodded their understanding and started on their gear. Any part of their body exposed to the frigid elements could freeze. They pulled on their full head and neck cold weather masks made of a soft nylon-coated neoprene, and then the three put on gloves, checked their boot buckles, and zipped up their brown fur-lined, hooded, white parkas. The helicopter landed, and two men and a woman disembarked with bags of equipment and clothes and headed toward the facility. A polar wind hit them the moment they stepped off the aircraft, chilling them to the bone, and they hurried toward the station. Once they cleared the pad, the helicopter lifted off and threw snow on them. The three stopped at the entrance.

The younger man urged, "Hurry, Dr. Seeker, before we freeze out here."

"I'm going as fast as I can." The older man placed his right gloved hand on a machine, a thermal scanner read his palm through the material, and the device confirmed his identity. "There, now we can go in."

The facility's metal door unlocked, slid up, and then two S.C.Ms. rushed out. They wore dark blue parkas with white fur-lined hoods. They aimed their black FAMAS at the three. The two men and the woman raised their hands as the head of the Vulcan Station followed behind the Corporate Military men. He wore a white parka.

"Dr. John Gelid?" the older man questioned, wondering why they were being treated this way.

"Yes." The head of the facility offered his gloved hand and shook the older man's. "And you must be Dr. Robert Seeker." John motioned for the S.C.Ms. to proceed. "Scan them and make sure they are human and then search them and their things."

"What's the meaning of this?" Robert demanded as he and his companions lowered their hands.

John smiled, trying to reassure them. "Don't worry, Dr. Seeker, this is only a precaution. Of what we know, we are the only Factory facility still in operation." The wind whipped the brown fur of his hood. "We have to remain operational till the Sphinx Corporation Main Branch Office can send us in some support, and I'm sorry to say, but the T-3s are very clever."

An S.C.M. looked around skittishly. "One of those flipped out machines already tried to enter the station two days ago." He eyed the younger of the two men. "Now isn't a good day for taking in new recruits."

"Lieutenant Bentley!" John snapped. "I believe we have frightened our guests quite enough."

"You might run the station, Dr. Gelid, but security is my responsibility." Bentley walked over to the younger of the two men. "Who is this, Dr. Seeker?"

"My assistant Charles, Charles Smith. I vouch for him. He's worked with me for years."

Bentley snarled at the assistant. "I don't trust him, so he better be on his best behavior."

"What's this?" the other S.C.M. questioned the woman.

"A cigar box." She opened the ten-inch by ten-inch container. "Cubans. One of my vices."

The S.C.M. nodded, seeing the cigars. "All clear."

"Good, let's get out of this arctic air." John waved for the three arrivals to follow him in. "Dr. Seeker, you were supposed to be here days ago."

"Yes, I'm sorry." Robert paused to let the woman walk in before him. "There was a hold up getting a pilot and a helicopter to fly us down here."

The door slid shut once everyone was in, and Bentley locked the door and had the other S.C.M. guard the entrance.

"Well, we're glad to have you here. I hope our work can help Research Project Clean Air." John pushed down his hood, removed his mask, and unzipped his parka. He took off the coat, revealing he wore several layers of clothing. "You should find our ice core samples helpful in your research."

Everyone else removed their cold weather masks.

"It's what I'm hoping for." Robert unzipped his coat. "Since the cores contain climate records for almost a million years, I'm confident they will shed some light on the planet's Dry Cloud problem." He removed his gloves. "One thing we haven't been able to explain is why those born in the Dark Half and those that lived there several years can breathe the polluted air without some side effects. There are particles of petroleum and other harmful elements in the air, so why aren't traces of them found in the blood or lungs of the Dark Half's residents?" Robert scratched his head. "One of many puzzles like the biggest one of all. What caused the Dry Clouds? They appeared overnight. I guess we won't solve the mystery so quickly." Robert glanced around. "Where do we start?"

"Do you wish to rest or at least freshen up first?" John asked.

"No." Robert rubbed his hands together to warm them. "I would prefer to get to work."

"Right, then." John motioned to the lieutenant. "I'll have Bentley take your things to your rooms, and we can begin."

Robert nodded and said, "Stephanie."

The woman stepped forward. "Yes, Dr. Seeker."

"Go help the lieutenant."

She grabbed some of their suitcases and followed Bentley and once they were some distance down a hall, she asked, "Do you have much wildlife here? I didn't see a thing the helicopter ride over."

Bentley looked annoyed over his bellboy job. "Only the occasional lost Skua; it's a brown bird." He glanced at her. "Would there be an extra Cuban in that box of yours?"

"We'll see. Maybe one."

They turned a corner.

"This way Dr. Seeker and Mr. Smith." John walked down a hall, opposite the one the lieutenant went down. "The main lab is this way."

Before the men followed, a loud noise boomed from the entrance, and the S.C.M. guarding it turned, taking a few steps back as the large door shook. Something hit the entrance again, and the metal door vibrated, toppling ice to the floor. The third, fourth, and fifth hits smashed the side of the door, and the S.C.M. leaped back. Five T-3s stood outside, covered with snow and ice, and they held a six-foot battering ram, dropped it, and started through the opening. The S.C.M. shot, and the T-3s evaded his fire. He started to radio for help, but a T-3 shot him in the head.

"Run!" John shouted. "The T-3s have penetrated Vulcan Station!"
Chapter Fifty-six

The Takeover of Vulcan Station

Five T-3s smashed their way into the facility, and their searing scarlet dot-light glowed in the ice dust. Bentley and Stephanie ran back down the hall, joining the three men.

"Un-Men have broken in," Bentley radioed. "Security to the entrance." He opened fire. "Doctors, run!"

The three men and the woman rushed further into the station and soon, ten S.C.Ms. ran in, passed them, and opened fire on the T-3s. They managed to disable one of them but lost five of their own, and the remaining four T-3s marched forward.

"Fall back!" Bentley ordered, but before he or his men could react, a metal sphere the size of a golf ball rolled past him toward the T-3s. The sphere halted, glowed, and shrilled. Bentley turned. "A high impact grenade. Get down!"

The blast knocked the S.C.Ms. to the ground and destroyed the T-3s. Bentley peered up as the snow and ice settled. His body felt on fire, and he wasn't sure what had happened or who threw the grenade.

Stephanie walked past a pile of cigars she'd dropped to the floor. She had removed the Cubans to pull out the hidden explosive. Stephanie moved to Bentley's side, holding the empty cigar box in one hand and a lit cigar in the other. She placed the box on the ground, put the cigar in her mouth, and picked up an assault rifle from one of his dead men. Stephanie made her way to the T-3s and put a bullet in each of their foreheads and then returned to Bentley's side.

Blood trickled from his mouth as he started to question, "Why did you–"

"Shh..." She knelt beside him. "Quiet. The Un-Men are dead. Everything will be alright now."

"Why did you throw the grenade so close to us?" Bentley looked at the other S.C.Ms. "You should have waited till we were clear. You've killed them."

She lightly smacked him on the cheek twice. "I didn't want to waste the explosive only on the Un-Men. You know the saying, why drop one egg when you can drop two?"

"I don't understand," he said.

"Maybe you'll understand this..." Stephanie removed the cigar from her mouth and placed the Cuban in Bentley's. "One for the road." She stood and shot him in the heart then made her way to the remaining men.

"Oh, my Zeus! Stephanie, what have you done?" Robert questioned.

"What I was told." She grinned, aimed for Dr. Seeker, then changed aim, and shot Charles between the eyes, and the assistant slumped to the floor and then blood pooled around his face.

"Hades! She's here to destroy the station," John said, backing up against a wall. "I take it you work for the Council?"

"She's here to kill us?" Robert blurted and shook his head. "No, my work."

"Yes, I work for the Council," Stephanie answered. "And I'm here to secure Vulcan Station, but I'm not here to kill you two."

"You aren't going to kill us?" Robert sounded relieved.

"No." She motioned with her weapon for them to go into a small lab, and Stephanie closed and locked the door once they entered and then turned to them. "The Council said to leave you two alive, that your work could be valuable to them." She leaned the assault rifle against a wall and walked over to a table, and there she found a laser cutter that was used to slice the ice cores into pieces. She tested it on the table, and the laser burned small holes into the top. "But they said nothing about torture." Stephanie made her way to them.

"Be reasonable," John said. "If you hurt us, why would we work for the Council?"

"Fear," she answered.

"Fear?" Robert questioned.

"Yes, fear. Fear that I'll do it again if you do not do as the Council wishes." She turned the laser on them and seconds later, the men screamed as she began her fun.

Somewhere in Noir...

The Chamber...

"Cerberus has completed its mission," Ms. Nona reported. "With one test, Cerberus has surpassed Pandora."

"Yes, the new experiment did not hesitate to kill the S.C.Ms. or Charles Smith." Pleased by the outcome, Mr. Decuma smiled. "Cerberus did not disobey orders."

"Yes, a fitting first trial," Ms. Nona added.

"Pandora never disobeyed," Mr. Morta retorted. "We never gave it any orders but one. Stay alive, and that it did."

Mr. Decuma smacked his hand on the table. "You must admit it! Pandora is a failure!" He calmed himself. "It is time for its termination."

"Yes," Ms. Nona agreed. "And what better way than to have Cerberus kill Pandora. The test will prove the superiority of the new project."

Mr. Morta said, "I believe it is premature to eliminate Pandora. We can still learn–"

Mr. Decuma interrupted, "This time you have been outvoted."

"The first time this Council has not been of one mind," Ms. Nona said. "And hopefully the last."

"Pandora's fate is out of my hands." Mr. Morta nodded to an analyst. "Give Cerberus its orders. The new experiment is to find Pandora and report in."

The male analyst nodded and relayed the order.

Mr. Morta realized Pandora's era was coming to an end, and he hoped what little time she had been put to good use.

From Moscow, With Love

9:45 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Old Business Vicinage...

Nikolai and Natasha walked into Jack's Hard Luck Pawn; it was one of many dealers on Wayfaring Lane. They removed their Winnow Masks. The colossal man with a buzz cut wore a black trench coat, and he stood by the front door as his sister proceeded to the owner. Natasha waited till the only other customer left the shop.

With her heavy Russian accent, she started, "I heard you're the man to see." Natasha raked her hand through her long black hair.

"What are you looking for?" Jack lit a NicPhake cigarette and took a long drag as he looked her up and down. "Jewelry? Watches?"

"We're bird hunting," she replied.

"Bird hunting, you say?" Jack raised a gray eyebrow.

"Yes, a very rare bird."

"Rare? What are–"

Nikolai moved forward and interrupted the owner, "We arrived from Moscow, and Voice said you could help us."

"Puck... Why didn't you say so to begin with?" Jack waved for the two of them to join him behind the counter. "Come with me. I've got some stuff in the back that should be to your liking." He rang a buzzer at a door and waved at the security camera. "You guys look professional. You here to hit anyone I know?"

Natasha and her brother moved behind the counter and stood behind Jack.

She answered, "All you need to know is that a mistake was made."

Nikolai added, "And we are here to rectify it."

The door unlocked, and Jack proceeded in as they followed. Five rough looking men stood in the next room. Two hung out talking while the other three cleaned guns. The room fell silent as all five men watched the two outsiders enter.

Nikolai was impressed by their arsenal as he looked around. "You have enough weapons in here to supply a small army."

"Yeah." Jack puffed on the cigarette. "I inherited the place from my cousin, Wayne. He was well connected but couldn't keep his mouth shut. Pucking looser... His loose lips got him killed." He took the cigarette out of his mouth and flicked white-pink ash in a Styrofoam cup of old coffee. "What do you need?"

Nikolai answered, "The guns are on this list."

"And throwing knives," Natasha interrupted her brother.

Jack took the list, looking it over. "This I can do." He pointed to two of his guys. "Get what they need." Jack handed the men the list, turned to a computer, and typed out an invoice.

The two men left and returned a few minutes later, and one of the men walked up to Natasha.

"Which one of these bad boys is for you, babe?" The man patted the guns. "By the way, the name's Ron."

"None of those." She studied the man that was about six inches taller than herself. "The knives are mine. They are my Sweets."

"Sweets, huh..." Ron handed them to her. "A fine babe like yerself likes to play with sharp things. You like to play with dangerous things. How about we step out for a little while? I'll show you something dangerous and maybe something a little sweet."

Nikolai moved toward the man, and Nikolai stated, "She is not interested."

Natasha said nothing, knowing what was coming. She removed her white fur-lined black coat, revealing tight-fitting red leather pants, vest, and boots. Natasha placed the coat on the back of a chair and inserted a set of throwing knives in a sheath around each wrist.

"You her boyfriend?" he asked the Closer.

"No," Nikolai replied. "I am her brother."

"Stay out of this then," Ron said. "It's none of your business."

Natasha almost felt sorry for the man. If Ron had dropped it, her brother might have only punched him in the mouth.

Nikolai controlled his anger. "She is not interested in the likes of you."

Ron jabbed his finger into the colossal man's chest. "You're her brother, not her mother. Let the babe decide."

Jack hit the print button on the computer for the invoice. "Don't do anything stupid, Ron."

"I know what I'm doing." Ron caressed her butt. "What do you say, babe?"

The veins in Nikolai's neck bulged with fury, and his eyes went wild like a mad grizzly bear and with one massive hand, the Russian reached out, grabbed the man by the throat, and choked him. The other men in the room drew their weapons and aimed at the siblings. Ron pulled a Glock 19, and Nikolai grabbed his wrist and squeezed it till Ron released the gun, and it hit the floor.

"Wait!" Jack cried out to his men and motioned with his hands. "Put your guns down." Sweat beaded his face, fearing the situation would get out of hand. "You don't know who these two are. If Voice sent them... Well... They'll kill you." He swallowed hard. "Puck! They'll kill all of us."

His men reluctantly complied as Nikolai continued to choke Ron. Natasha put her coat back on.

"You do not touch my sister in an impertinent way. No one treats my sister that way."

The man clawed Nikolai's arm, unable to breathe, and his eyes bugged out.

"Please, be reasonable," Jack pleaded. "Puck, let him go, and he can apologize."

"No." Nikolai squeezed harder, and the veins in his hand bulged. "I warned him, so I offer no mercy."

Natasha walked over to her brother and rubbed her hand up and down his back. She moved to Ron, leaned to him, and whispered in his ear, "From Moscow, with love." Natasha nodded to her brother, and Nikolai forcibly turned the man's head toward her. She French kissed Ron as he clawed at her brother's arm. She finished, stepped back, and said, "We will have to write up extra paperwork on your death, but I am pleased and that will make it worth it."

Ron's eyes rolled back, and Nikolai released his corpse, then reached down, and picked up the Glock 19. "His weapon is now mine." He tucked the gun into the back waistband of his pants.

Natasha looked down at the dead man and smiled. "You had asked me a question. You wanted to know what I say. I say you should have listened to my brother." She turned to Jack. "How much do we owe you for the weapons?"

Unable to say anything as he stared at the dead man, Jack handed her the invoice with a shaky hand.

She stated, "Voice will have the funds in your account by tonight."

Still shocked, Jack nodded.

Natasha and her brother headed out with the guns in two large duffle bags and once they were outside, they put their Winnow Masks on and checked the streets for police. They placed the duffle bags in the trunk of their black Cadillac. He unzipped one, removed a case, and opened the container.

"Finally, I have Tommy." Nikolai smoothed his hand across a machine gun. "And I can be the Hood I dreamed of being."

She rolled her eyes. "Whatever makes you happy. Now come and let us be on our way."

He put the machine gun back and within a few minutes, they got into the car and took off their masks. Nikolai removed the trophy he took off of Ron and placed the Glock 19 in the glove box.

"Let us hurry with our assignment." Natasha glanced out the passenger side window at the darkness surrounding the city. "I grow to hate this place."

Her brother pulled the car out into traffic. "Our final task is four days away and once we have killed the Phoenix, we can leave Noir."

"Voice is as forgiving as you, my brother. Voice must never be crossed."

"Yes," her brother agreed. "We must always complete our assignments with no hesitation and with no remorse. Our hearts must not rule our minds or our actions. In our line of business, it can only bring death."

Introductions

This series uses a mixture of omniscient past tense and first person present tense to tell the story of Shades of Gray. I have used bold to separate the first person from the omniscient. Enjoy the series.

I have glimpsed into the future and seen a world of darkness and sorrow. It was a place where the clouds hid the sun and human machines walked and terrorized the land, but there was nothing darker or more horrifying than the hearts of those who lived there.

Will no one save them?

Chapter One

The Raven And the Wolf

The year 32 A.D.C...

October 22...

Friday...

6:23 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

The blackness of night hung over the early morning as mile-thick Dry Clouds shrouded Noir's sky, and they hung over the city like a sleeping dragon. They were a sleeping dragon that the Earth feared one day would wake and devour them, and so far, no magic of science could stop the beast. Purple lightning lit up the heavens, but the density of the barriercumulus muffled the thunder as a Common Raven flew below the clouds, dove into a park, and landed on a branch of a Transgenic Maple. Scattered lamps lit up the dark empty paths surrounding the tree as a cold wind rustled the hybrid maple's leaves and the blades of the spongy Transgenic Grass that surrounded the truck's base. The breeze suddenly died. The large bird heard a twig snap and tilted its head, staring at a bush as a pale-white Tundra Wolf emerged and looked up with its golden-yellow eyes at the raven. Their gazes locked.

Across the street from the park...

A black Cadillac stopped at a curb, and Nikolai, wearing a white pinstriped gray business suit and a WM-A, got out of the driver's side. He placed a gray Fedora hat on his head, smoothed its rim, straightened a white tie, and shut the door.

Natasha exited the passenger's side also wearing a filter mask. Natasha, a Life Closer like her twin brother, inhaled through the triangular filter over her nose and exhaled through her mouth. She looked at the old apartments in front of them and then to the park across the street which was mostly empty. Natasha removed her white fur-lined, long, black coat, revealing a tight-fitting red leather outfit. It consisted of pants, a vest, and high heel knee boots. She threw the coat in the back seat, grabbed a black leather satchel from the front floor, and closed the door. She checked on her throwing knives' sheaths that were velcroed to each wrist.

"My Sweets..." Natasha spoke as she caressed the blades on her left wrist with her index finger. "Ready for some action?"

Natasha made her way to the back, joining her brother as Nikolai popped the trunk with a remote, lifted a case, and set it on the sidewalk.

He removed his mask and asked, "How does it look?"

His sister glanced up and down the deserted street and then answered, "It is clear."

Natasha replaced the WM-A to her face. He set his mask in the trunk, holstered a Glock 25, grabbed the mask, closed the trunk, and picked up the case.

She motioned to the case and spoke, "I cannot believe you are going to use that thing." Her Russian accent clung to every word as she added, "It is ancient."

Nikolai patted the case as he said, "Tasha, I like it for this kind of job."

"You mean the kind of job where it does not matter how messy it gets. Remember my brother, this is still a Life Closing so please be professional."

"I always am."

Nikolai winked at her and started up a gravel path, crunching over rocks with his black cap toe shoes. He made his way to the apartment's entrance and entered the glass front door and once inside, they both removed their WM-A, he handed his to his sister, and Natasha placed both of them in her satchel. He waited by the door as she continued in, and he watched over her as she neared the security desk.

A security guard in his early thirties looked up from the desk and stood, seeing the tall woman, and his gaze slowly ran up her tall leggy figure before he asked, "Can I help you?"

He adjusted his pants and his belt and holster, made his way to the front of the desk, and approached her. Natasha leaned to him and whispered something Nikolai couldn't hear, the guard grinned as he spoke back to her in muffled words Nikolai couldn't understand, and then he saw his sister giggle. The guard leaned on the desk and continued to talk as Natasha glanced back and saw that her brother was watching them intently, and then she placed her hand on the guard's arm. Nikolai noticed the lustful eye the guard gave his sister and scowled as his body ignited with rage. He put the case down, marched forward, pulled his Glock as jealousy spurred his hand, and fired once, hitting the man in the knee and then with gleeful pleasure, he watched the guard fall and grab his leg, squirming in pain like the worm he was.

"Brother! What are you doing?" Natasha asked as she folded her arms, knowing that once his temper erupted there was no stopping him. She would have to talk him down before they could proceed and so was her duty as his sister and partner. "We were not ordered to kill security."

"Did you see how he looked at you?" Nikolai questioned her as he marched to the man like a crazed bear. "I will gouge out his eyes and rip off his bollocks!"

She ran her fingers through her long hair, continuing to talk him down, but not before she teased him into a frenzy. It was already too late for the guard, so she might as well enjoy his death.

"I am a beautiful woman." She grabbed both of her breasts and massaged them with her hands as she inquired, "What do you expect? He only wanted to fondle me, he said so, and he also said that he wanted to take me to plains of ecstasy."

"He said that?" Nikolai yelled as his sister slowly walked over to him, he fired a round into the man's heart, killing him and then he turned, looking for others he could murder as he stated, "No one will look at you like that or say such things to you!"

Natasha looked at the dead man. His death had been a little too quick for her taste. Maybe the Closing upstairs would satisfy her morbid lust, and she said, "The guard never said that to me." She ran her fingers up her brother's massive arm to his back and then wrapped her arms around his waist, gripping him tightly in the front as she whispered, "How many times must I tell you that you cannot kill every man that glances at me?" She moved to the front of him and placed both her hands on his face, then Natasha saw his eyes bulge out in rage as they searched the area for more vile men he could kill, and she said, "There will be many, and you cannot kill all of them."

"But he..." Nikolai started till his sister leaned in and kissed him on the lips. The rage seething in him lessened, and he relaxed as he adoringly looked at his sister and kissed her back. She finished, and he told her, "I am sorry. I lost myself again."

"It is fine but do not let it happen–"

A second guard exited an elevator, interrupting her and when the guard saw that Nikolai had killed his partner, the guard dropped his coffee and pulled his Python 4 revolver as he blurted, "Hold it right there!"

As the guard covered her brother, Natasha reached for her left wrist, pulled a knife from the sheath, threw it, and hit the man in the throat. The guard fired as he grabbed at the steel in his windpipe, and the wild shot hit the glass front door and shattered it. Shards rained, pinging to the tiled floor as the guard dropped his weapon and collapsed to his knees. He choked on his blood as he pulled a radio.

Natasha walked over to him and kicked his revolver away as he tried to use the radio but only made gurgling sounds. He was lying on his back, so she sat on his stomach, looked at him with pity, covered his eyes with her left hand, and told him, "Do not look. The pain will be over soon." Natasha leaned to his ear and whispered, "From Moscow, with love. Now I will give you the Executioner's Adieu."

She moved to his lips as blood bubbled from them and French kissed him, tasting a mixture of coffee and metallic saliva. He fought her erotic oral assault and dropped the radio to grab her arm and push her off but before he could, she removed the knife from his windpipe. Blood spurted her face and neck, and she arched back stimulated by the red gore and uttered a soft moan as her body tingled. Aroused by the blood, she watched as the guard held his throat, trying to prevent his own demise.

Natasha waited till he died, wiped the knife on his shirt, cleaning off his blood, and sheathed the blade, and then she leaned to his ear and whispered to him as uncalloused as she could, "I am sorry. You were not meant to die, but you should know that I did enjoy your death." She stood, took one more moment to look at the man, walked to her brother, and berated him, "Look what has happened. We will have to file extra reports, and you know how I hate excess work. Not only that..." She glanced back at the second guard and then turned to her brother, questioning him, "How are we going to explain your actions to Voice and the Assassins Guild? You needlessly killed the first guard. He would not have stopped us from going up."

He hung his head like a scolded child, and then he replied, "I do not know."

"We will say the guard tried to stop us and that you had to shoot him and the second guard saw us kill his partner and we had to kill him also. But you cannot keep doing this. Voice will find out."

"If that happens, we will become marked for closing like the Phoenix."

"Yes, like the Phoenix," Natasha repeated as she smiled at her sulking brother. "Now cheer up. You still have your new toy to play with."

"You are right." He went, picked up the case, and said, "Come, Tasha." He entered an elevator, pressed button thirty-one, and added, "Let us go blip off the bird."

Puzzled by what her brother meant by his statement, she raised a black eyebrow, followed, and said, "Remember the Closing File states we keep collateral damage to a minimum."

"A minimum, not zero."

"Please do not kill anyone outside of the apartment," she told him as the elevator started up, and then she removed a gold compact and a white silk handkerchief from her satchel. She looked into the mirror and wiped some of the splatter from her face and neck as she said, "If we go out later, I will have to clean up. The guard is all over my face." She placed both items back into her satchel, the cab opened, and the two of them walked out as she asked, "What apartment number are we looking for?"

Nikolai removed an H.H.C. from his suit pocket as they walked from the end of the hall, and he looked at the numbers on the doors before they passed them and stopped. "This is the one."

She noticed a dark crack beneath the door and whispered, "The lights are out, so they are probably still sleeping. Do you want to knock?"

"Knock? No, not with this heat," he spoke as he patted the case, set it on the floor, opened it, and removed a Thompson Submachine Gun. "This bean-shooter announces itself."

"Of all the people to idolize, you had to pick 1930's gangsters."

"Every gink needs a hobby. I happen to be good at two."

Natasha said, "Half the time, I do not know what you are saying."

Nikolai winked at her, made sure she was safely away, then stood back, shot several rounds into the frame near the knob, and kicked in the splintered door. Light from the hallway rushed into the apartment as he proceeded down an entry and an armed man appeared at the dark end. Nikolai fired, dropping the man and headed into the pitch black living room. He heard two men whispering, and Nikolai yelled like a maniac and wildly shot in their direction as gun blast lit up his smirking face. The men who were hiding behind a couch fired a round apiece and missed him before the Tommy sliced through the sofa and cut them down. Nikolai flipped on a light, retrieved his case, and reloaded, then he headed down a hallway, and kicked in the master bedroom door. The light was on, and a man was in bed with two women. The man had pulled an Olympic 6 revolver from a nightstand.

"I'll blow your head off!" the man threatened.

The women squealed, covering themselves with the sheet, and one of them asked, "Vicky, is this another one of your sick games?"

"No, babe, not this time," he answered as he aimed the revolver, and then he cursed, "Puck! I don't know who this guy is." He snarled and yelled, "I'm Vic the Vulture. You don't know who yer messing with! I've got a contract with the Valhalla Corporation." The man shot at him as he yelled, "I'm under their protection!"

The bullet grazed Nikolai's shoulder and in anger, he grabbed the gun from Vic and pistol-whipped him. One of the women screamed and covered her face with her hands as Nikolai continued to hit the man. He finished and threw Vic's gun across the room.

Nikolai pointed the Tommy up, put one foot on the bed, and leaned toward Vic as he spat, "Here's the wire, lug. Your Chicago overcoat has done been fitted."

Vic grabbed his bloodied cheek as he asked, "What are you blabbering about, you mother-pucker? What you're saying doesn't make any sense. All I know is yer dead! Dead when the corporation finds out you messed with me!"

"Shut your trap! Your yap's why I'm here. Your so-called friends at Valhalla found out that the trade secrets you were supposed to be brokering for them you've also been selling off to other corporations." Nikolai's demeanor changed from one of a wise guy to a serious Life Closer as he spoke, "Victor L. Boons also known as Vic the Vulture, on behalf of Valhalla, I am terminating your contract."

"Wait! You can't! They can't! Puck! It's a mistake. I've only sold to Valhalla!"

"It is no use lying to me. They have audio evidence that you did it."

"I... I can explain. Let me get their Vice President on the phone."

"Did you not read your contract with them?" Nikolai questioned as he shook his head, irritated by the man's ignorance, and then he said, "You should have read it more closely. By signing, you agreed to the Life Closer Clause should you violate the contract and there are no second chances." He glanced at the two hookers and said, "It is a pity these two women are here. They would not have to die if they had not seen my face." Nikolai opened up one last volley, and the women screamed. White goose down flew up from the dozens of bullet impacts in the mattress. The feathers fell like snow, landing on the three bodies, and blood slowly tainted the down as Nikolai added, "As stipulated, your employment has been terminated."

"My turn has finally come," Natasha said as she walked into the bedroom behind Nikolai. She had already secured the rest of the apartment. Natasha watched as Vic gasped, clinging to life then she walked over to him, bent down, and whispered in his ear, "From Moscow, with love. Now I will give you the Executioner's Adieu." Natasha French kissed him and as she intertwined her tongue with his, Vic died, and then she straightened, wiping the blood from her lips with her index finger and said, "The Closing was most enjoyable." Natasha turned, saw her brother's wound, and scolded him, "Look at you. I hope you are happy." She examined the minor shoulder graze as she said, "See what you get for wanting to play with your toy. You could have used a handgun with a silencer." She glanced at the man in bed whose glassy eyes stared up at the ceiling, and then she spoke, "If you had, Vic the Vulture would not have even known you were here, but you wanted to go all Al Ca-put."

Nikolai pointed the Tommy gun up again as if posing for a picture, and then he informed her, "He was named Al Capone, and it was worth it, my sister. I do feel like a gangster." He smoothed his fingers across the rim of his Fedora as he spoke, "Place our calling card so we may leave before Noir Civil Police Force is called in. Dealing with the N.C.P.F. could be time-consuming so let our calling card talk for us."

She nodded, walked over to Vic, and placed a business card of a wolf and a raven on his chest. A barcode printed on the bottom of the card included the Life Closers' information, and the N.C.P.F. would use this card to verify the killings were Life Closings and not murders.

"We only have one more assignment to complete and then we can leave this wretched Dark Half."

"Yes, my sister. We only need to bop the Phoenix and we can return home to Mother Russia."

"It will not be so easy," Natasha said. "We do not know what the Phoenix looks like. Is this Life Closer a man, woman, or child? All we have is an appointed time and place for the Closing from Voice to find the Phoenix," she paused and then added, "And I do wish you would stop talking that way. Honestly, I do not know what you meant when you said you want to bop the Phoenix; it kind of had a sexual connotation which I hope you did not intend."

"No," he spoke as his face reddened. "I did not mean–"

She put her hand under his chin, reached up, kissed him on the cheek, and said, "Come then, I am famished. We will clean up, and I will tend to your shoulder and after that is done, we can see what fine delights Noir has to offer."
Chapter Two

A Past Mistake

Nineteen days earlier...

October 3...

Wednesday...

6:01 P.M...

The Light Side...

Russia...

The end of the day swept across Moscow's Red Square as hundreds of tourists visited St. Basil's Cathedral, GUM department store, the Historical Museum, and many other attractions. The clear western sky exploded with hues of orange and red as the sun started its descent. Twilight approached this part of the Light Side of the planet, and it was a place where the sun existed, separating day from night. Dry Clouds didn't pollute the air or obscure the heavens and darkness didn't rule the land. Eventually, even this part of the world would be covered if the Dry Clouds were not stopped; they spread about an inch every week.

Ten days before meeting Kat, Kim walked out of GUM department store and put on sunglasses before stepping out into the early evening to protect her eyes. A native of the Dark Half of the planet, the sun's light hurt her even near the twilight hours. She pulled back her blonde hair, tied it in a ponytail, buttoned up her long dark gray coat, and pulled on black gloves. Kim straightened a black knapsack slung over one shoulder as she noticed a woman holding a little girl in her arms and grinned. She had fond memories of her own mother that was until Kim turned eighteen. Her mother had left her and her father without a word nearly twenty years ago. At this time in her life, Kim hadn't yet discovered the truth about Theresa.

Kimberly's view...

I make my way out of Red Square, then hurry to Kalancheveskaya Street, and rush to the rooftop of the Leningradskaya Hotel, making sure no one sees me. I reach the rooftop just as the sun plunges over the horizon, and I pause, taking in a little of the life around me. Darkness starts to flood the sky as I remove my sunglasses and place them in the pocket of my coat. The beauty that we who live on the Dark Half miss, you don't realize its splendor until you witness it in person. The sun's so beautiful, and the colors that break across the horizon as it disappears for the day are mesmerizing. I inhale deeply, fill my lungs with the brisk air, exhale, and my hot breath appears as mist. The air smells clean unlike Noir's, and it energizes me and makes me feel more alive. The chill in the air tells me Winter will soon overtake Fall.

The sun completely disappears, and this world on the Light Side of the planet, even as night spreads across it, is so wonderfully different. I glance up at the cloudless night and notice the stars are so bright. I can't even imagine that Noir's sky looked like this once.

I pull on a knit mask to hide my identity, not that I expect anyone to come up here and see me. I wait for two hours near the ledge, keep to the shadows, and monitor the lit sidewalk below with binoculars. I came up here earlier than I had too, but I like to get the layout of the land before I take out a Mark. I place my knapsack near the ledge, move to a different part of the roof, and pull out a large case a Guild Prep/Cleanup Crew hid the day before. I remove the sections of an M24, put the sniper rifle together, then move back to the ledge, and peer down the block through the scope. My target's supposed to leave the tea house within the next hour. Many people go in and out of bars, eateries, and stores in the area. I glance at my watch, see it's time, place a silencer on the rifle, and kneel beside the ledge. I peer through the scope and aim at the entrance of the tea house. I remove an H.H.C. from my coat pocket, open up the Closing File on the touch screen, and study the picture of the Mark one more time. Voice told me the Mark will receive a phone call around this time and draw her out, so all I have to do is wait.

A minute turns into ten, and soon the woman walks out of the tea house along with four armed bodyguards. I aim for the woman's heart, waiting for a clear shot as people walk by her on the sidewalk. A limo pulls up, and one of the bodyguards moves to the vehicle and opens the back door. I put my finger on the trigger ready to pull it when the target pauses and turns back. A little girl runs out of the tea house and takes the woman's hand. The child holds something in her other hand.

I glance up from the scope. Voice said nothing about the woman having a child. Hades! It should have been included in the Closing File. I peer back through the scope, taking aim again, and I place my finger back on the trigger. The woman and the child walk forward to enter the limo and pause as the little girl kneels to tie her shoe. The child lays an object on the sidewalk, grabs her laces, and ties them.

My hands tremble, so I remove my finger from the trigger. Hades! I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm acting like this is my first kill but that happened years ago, and I have long since hardened my heart to my work. I take several deep breaths till my hands stopped shaking, and then I place my finger back to the trigger. I can't let whatever's affecting me to get in the way. I need to take the shot.

The child laughs and after finishing with her laces, the child picks up the object. She glances up at her mother with adoration.

I berate myself as I delay. It's my job. I have to kill the woman. For Ares' sake! It doesn't matter if the child's watching. My usual calm heart pounds with indecision. I can't let the thought of the child seeing her mother murdered affect me. Even in the cool air, sweat speckles my brow beneath the mask and absorbs into the material. I aim again and this time, I won't hesitate. A street vendor approaches, selling glowing balloons as I still struggle with the shot.

Hades! Pull the trigger! Who cares what happens to the little girl? I look up from the scope, thinking of my past. Look how I turned out without a mom. I shake my head to erase the feelings of abandonment, peer one last time into the scope and with shaky resolve, pull the trigger.

A balloon pops...
Chapter Three

Picking Up From Where We Left Off

Present time...

October 22...

Friday...

12:56 P.M...

Noir...

Hellenistic Sector, Commercial Vicinage...

Katharine's view...

A dim light illuminates a back alley as I glance around a corner of an old brick building and peer at the end of a deserted road. A ten-foot chain-link fence surrounds the back entrance of our destination. The wind blows a newspaper along the bottom of the barrier, changes direction, and flattens the debris against the diamond mesh. The newspaper flaps in the breeze before the wind tumbles it further down the road. I look within the fence and see an S.C.M. sitting in a guardhouse. He's reading a Guns&Knives magazine and drinking coffee and every ten minutes or so, he looks up from his reclined position. I imagined this place having better security as I glance at a scrap piece of paper; it's the address the hologram Theresa Griffin gave us. I sigh, disappointed with the defense and the rundown appearance of the building. It has to have some information about the Pandora Project. I couldn't have gotten my hopes up just to find nothing.

Kimberly stands beside me and peers through night vision binoculars. She wears her all black work outfit consisting of thin gloves, a tank top, jogging pants, running shoes, and a zipped up hooded sweatshirt. I'm wearing my usual white t-shirt, a gray-black athletic jacket, and gray-black pants.

"What do you see?" I ask her.

Kimberly's view...

"Considering who you are, I thought you would have supervision," I tell her, referring to her being the Pandora Project.

I reluctantly partnered with that strange woman four days ago, and I'm still uneasy about the collaboration. There's something about her... There's something I can't put my finger on. Hades! I hate this. I was told she's the key but never what she was the key of. I glance up from the binoculars, thinking about the Rogue. It claimed that she was organic-mecha, a robot that can completely pass as human. I think that would be worse than being some sort of messed up human experiment and considering the organic-mecha dilemma, I can't trust her or her motives for wanting to partner with me, not that I ever trusted her.

Katharine's view...

I see the mistrust in Kimberly's face and know the snide remarks are her way of keeping herself at arm's length. I don't know if she'll ever believe in my sincerity to help her. I glance at her again. Maybe something else is putting her on edge. It could be what the Rogue told her and if that's it, she has to see me as a freak. No wonder she can't trust me if she thinks I've been deceiving her.

I examine our time together so far, and I know one thing... our partnership's going nowhere.

I finally answer her, "No, I don't have supervision. All I see is the soldier."

"There's nothing else to see," Kimberly says as she hands me the binoculars.

I peer through them and look at the S.C.M., the guardhouse, and the loading dock behind the small building. He wears a dark green uniform and his shoulder patch has the Sphinx Corporation Emblem with the Council's Crest. On the top part of the large building is written "Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo". The S.C.M. confirms it. This place belongs to the Council. We just need to figure out what sort of place it is. I hand the binoculars back.

"Let's go to work," Kimberly tells me as she places the binoculars in the knapsack, removes a metal object, pulls her gun from a shoulder holster, and screws the silencer on her PPK.

I ask, "What are you doing?"

Kimberly's view...

"For Ares' sake! What does it look like I'm doing?" I snap as I glance at that woman.

I don't see anything special about her. She's plain looking with hazel eyes and short brown hair but maybe that in itself is a disguise. I just can't figure out if she's a weapon or one truly messed up person and why one of the departments in the Sphinx Corporation wants her. All I know is if she's important to them, they won't let her go so easily. Maybe I should end our partnership before it causes me any more grief. I can't let anyone live who knows I'm the Phoenix. Anonymity is life, so I shouldn't wait too long to eliminate the one who has seen my face and who knows that I'm a Life Closer.

I consider it a few seconds more and decide if I want to investigate the building, I'll need that woman, so I'll allow her to live a little longer until her negative points outweigh her usefulness.

As if my actions are a normal everyday thing, I point at the guard with my gun and answer her stupid question, "I'm going to take out that S.C.M. and go into that building. I'm going to see why this address was in the file labeled the Gorgons."

Katharine's view...

"You can't," I say, keeping my voice down so not to alert the S.C.M. "Killing's wrong. Everybody knows that."

"For Ares' sake... Of course, it's wrong," Kimberly whispers. "But how else are we going to get in? Hades! I can't believe we're arguing about this. Actually..." I see and feel her anger increase as she takes a step towards me and states, "I can't believe I'm letting you stop me from doing what I normally do." She pushes me up against the wall and tells me, "Now listen... I'm a Closer and this is what I do."

She releases me, starts around the corner, but then I grab her arm, and she turns and glares at me. I feel her stare bore right through me as if it's a laser. I want to shrink back and run away, but I stand my ground.

I release her wrist and say, "That doesn't make it right. Please, don't kill him." In a gentler tone, I add, "There are other ways."

Kimberly scoffs my idea as if it's too childish, and then she points toward the corner and demands, "Show me then." She dares me as if it's some sort of game, "Show me how you're going to get us in without him sounding an alarm."

"Watch me," I reply as I take on her challenge. "Maybe you'll learn something."

I remove my single strap backpack, open it, and pull out a Gel-Taser; it's a device that resembles a mini TV remote. I also remove a dog collar and then drop the backpack to the ground. I tuck the oblong silver Gel-Taser in my back pocket, walk around the corner, and start whistling.

"True! Here boy! Come here! Mommy's looking for you. True!" I walk right up to the gate and speak meekly, "Excuse me."

The S.C.M. sees my approach, so he puts his magazine and coffee down, grabs the XM8, and comes out to the entrance. He keeps the assault rifle at the ready and peers through the chain-link fence.

I act hopeful as I question, "Have you seen a dog?"

He relaxes his grip on the XM8 as he answers me, "No, I haven't seen one." The S.C.M. eyes me and must decide I'm not a threat and slings his assault rifle. He removes his cap and runs his hand through his short hair as he suggests, "Maybe you should try around Joe's Diner. His dumpster attracts hungry animals."

Back at the corner...

Kimberly's view...

I can't believe it. That woman walked right up to him. I let my amazement fade away. It doesn't matter if she's able to talk with the soldier without setting off any alarms. The real question is if she can get us in.

At the fence...

Katharine's view...

I glance at the dog collar, then back to him, and say, "I don't know where the diner is located. Could you give me directions?"

"Yeah. Hold on," he says as he goes back into the guardhouse and comes back with a Hellenistic Sector, Commercial Vicinage map. The S.C.M. points to the paper and gives me instructions, "We're here. Joe's up there. First, go back down the alley you came up, then..."

I step closer to the fence, scratch my mid-back, and slowly remove the Gel-Taser and with my thumb, I flip off the safety at the bottom of the weapon that's below a large red button. The soldier continues to talk as I palm the small device and move my hand to the fence. I carefully aim, press the red button, fire a green jelly string through the diamond mesh, and hit the man in the neck. The end of the gel substance clumps on impact, it forms an acorn size circle and adheres to his skin, and the rest of the string dangles still attached to the Gel-Taser. I press the large red button again as the S.C.M. grabs at the string, and 1,500 volts surged through the jelly. He cries out, convulses, and falls to the ground unconscious as I look around, making sure no one saw me, and then I hit a blue button that recoils the string. I set the safety, tuck the Gel-Taser back in my pocket, and climb the fence.

Back at the corner...

Kimberly's view...

I can't believe it! She actually did it... I holster my gun and run up as that woman buzzes the gate open, and I hand that woman her bag. I'm still quite amazed. I thought she would get captured. I might have lost out on finding out what's in the building but my Pandora problem would have been solved.

"Have you done this before?" I ask as I help her drag the man into the guardhouse.

"Actually, a couple of times," she replies as she takes his keycard, then places the Gel-Taser in her backpack and the keycard in her back pocket, and adds, "He'll be out at least two hours."

I glance at my watch and say, "Let's get inside and see what we find." A little impressed by that woman's tactics and excited to continue our game, I state, "See how far we can go without killing someone."
Chapter Four

The Council

1:19 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Unknown Vicinage...

The new Sanctum...

Within the Chamber...

"Come on people!" a male supervisor barked. "You're behind on your one o'clock reports. Let's get them in." After a few minutes, he scanned an H.H.C., moved to one of the twenty-four Chamber Analysts, and said, "You're the last one. What's the holdup?"

"It's these readings from the new project. There was so much to compile that–" the male analyst started, "–I didn't leave enough time to write out the report. I won't make the same mistake again."

"The Council doesn't tolerate inefficiency or errors."

"I know but like I said I discovered my miscalculation," the analyst restated as he sent in his report. "It won't happen again."

"Make sure it doesn't," the supervisor said as he went back to walking the line of workstations.

In the center of the Chamber...

The Council sat at a long rectangular table that was the darkest point of the room, and the laptops and H.H.Cs. were the only things that illuminated the immediate area. The Council monitored many black projects and on this day, they monitored one experiment in particular. Mr. Morta a tall man with a stout built sat at the head of the table.

The door to the Chamber opened and light from the hallway revealed Ms. Nona was a slim lilliputian and dwarfed Mr. Morta's frame. She sat to his right on a specially designed chair that raised her to the table.

Ms. Nona turned to her laptop and stated, "We are receiving a report from Cerberus." She typed across the keyboard with her cherry-red nails as she continued, "Vulcan Station is now in our hands. Two of our squads of Sphinx Corporate Military have already arrived in Antarctica, and the S.C.Ms. have taken over the base."

"Good, good," Mr. Morta said. "Vulcan Station was the last Factory facility in operation, and now the acquisition of our sister department's assets is complete." He paused and asked, "What of the two scientists at Vulcan Station?"

Mr. Decuma was a meager man of average height, and he sounded disappointed when he replied, "Cerberus did not kill them as instructed but–"

Mr. Morta demanded, "But what?"

Mr. Decuma answered, "Well..."

When he hesitated, Ms. Nona replied, "Dr. John Gelid and Dr. Robert Seeker were injured."

"How?" Mr. Morta questioned.

"Cerberus tortured them with a laser cutter," Mr. Decuma answered. "Both men have severe burns. They have been flown back and are recuperating in our medical facility."

Mr. Morta stated, "It would appear we need to be more precise in our instructions. We did want the cooperation of the scientists." He paused and questioned, "Where is Cerberus now?"

"It is flying back to Noir," Ms. Nona answered as she scanned the clock on her laptop. "Cerberus should arrive within a few hours."

Mr. Morta thought for a moment and asked, "How is Argus? I would like him to monitor Cerberus."

"He is still receiving care," Mr. Decuma said. "The injuries he received from the T-3s when they tortured him were not life-threatening. He should be ready to return to work in a few days."

"Did he give up any information about our work or the Sanctum?"

"He says no," Mr. Decuma replied. "He said that they were rescued before he broke."

"They?" Mr. Morta repeated, puzzled for a moment. "Ah, yes. The two Factory technicians we acquired. Tech One-eleven and Tech One-twelve. What are their names?"

"Peters and Maxwell," Mr. Decuma answered. "We never did find out who rescued them. The men are closed mouth about it."

"Do you believe Argus divulged any information?" Mr. Morta asked.

"No," Mr. Decuma replied. "We did condition him to withstand pain. The T-3s may have broken him with time but not in the short span that they had him. They had him three days to be precise."

Ms. Nona questioned, "What intel do we have on the T-3s?"

"The operatives we had following them turned up dead," Mr. Decuma answered as he scanned another H.H.C. "The last report we received from them stated they had left the Hellenistic Sector of Noir."

"Create a new team," Mr. Morta commanded. "The T-3s must be found. We cannot have these machines on the loose. One Rogue is enough."

Mr. Decuma went to work on the task and pulled up personnel files and after several minutes, he started compiling a new team.

Ms. Nona's laptop beeped, she opened the incoming message, and then she relayed, "I have received a new report. Cerberus has stated its excitement."

"Over what?" Mr. Morta questioned. "Cerberus is experiencing a full range of emotions, and I believe this is good."

"Over tracking and eliminating the Pandora Project," Ms. Nona answered and then bit her left thumbnail as she continued to study the data.

Mr. Morta sounded concerned as he inquired, "Does Cerberus understand it is not to terminate Pandora?"

"Yes," Ms. Nona answered as she moved her hand back to the laptop. "Cerberus anticipates the order will be given to take out Pandora, and it indicates it will study Pandora, so it will be better equipped to eliminate the old project."

Mr. Decuma questioned Mr. Morta, "Why do you hesitate in giving the termination order?"

"The Pandora Project's tracking beacon was destroyed, but we still receive bio-data from Pandora," Mr. Morta spoke, sensing Mr. Decuma was suspicious of his recent actions, and he tried to put his mind at ease by explaining it away with a question, "Do you remember what happened two days ago?"

"Yes," Ms. Nona answered. "We received an influx of data, indicating Pandora reached the Delta Phase of its metamorphosis; it indicated that it had reached the Knowing."

"The data cannot be correct," Mr. Decuma insisted as he tapped the table with his finger and added, "There is no possible way the old project reached the Delta Phase without first achieving the Gamma, and its bio-data indicates that phase was never achieved."

"Do you both agree then?" Mr. Morta questioned, hoping to change their minds or postpone a negative decision. "We should suspend Pandora's termination. We must analyze the bio-data and once we have the correct information, we can decide whether or not to destroy Pandora." He rested his elbows on the arms of the chair, folded his dark brown hands, and then continued, "If the readings are corrupt, it is one thing but if the readings are true..." Mr. Morta hoped to give his favorite project some more time, and he said, "We should investigate it further. We did want Pandora to reach all of its phases, and we want it to become the killer we programmed it to be."

The other two glanced at each other and nodded.

"I have one condition," Mr. Decuma insisted. "We will terminate Pandora even if the information is inconclusive."

Mr. Morta nodded reluctantly and said, "It is agreed. Cerberus will observe Pandora. We will hold off termination until we have had enough time to study the data."

He had bought Pandora a little more time, and he hoped she would find the answers she was seeking.
Chapter Five

The Rogue's New Focus

1:41 P.M...

Near the Hellenistic Sector's boundary...

Within the shambles of the Factory...

The Rogue repaired the artificial epidermis covering its pale face as it stood in one of the many rooms the Factory devoted to bio-mecha research, especially, the assassin line of Un-Men. The room was labeled Bio-mecha Research Seventeen or BR17. The area under its left eye had been damaged two days ago in a battle with Pandora. It stared at a table mirror with its red artificial eyes, then the Rogue noted its eyes looked more like red ringed spheres, and it also noted the dingy brown business suit it wore had black oil covering its left jacket's arm. It went back to work and used a soldering iron to melt patches of skin to its damaged face. The skin was made from a manmade substance known as X-74.

The Rogue's view...

I pause from my work and set down the solder, thinking Pandora did a number on me. I came close to ending her existence, but she reached the Delta Phase of her metamorphosis and stopped me. Pandora shot me when no one else could.

I consider the past year and wonder why out of all my programming I cannot disobey the one to destroy Pandora. I find pleasure in hunting her, but I am an Un-Man, and I appear to be showing feelings and have self-awareness. This should not be.

I also consider in great depth the other thing that happened to me. Even though I tried to kill Pandora, she spared my life. She had the power to take it, yet she fled the room. She showed me mercy as if she knew something that I did not. Is there another purpose to my existence?

I think back to my discovery. After our encounter, I stumbled across the hidden chamber in the back of the Gallery and then later after I had gone through some of the Factory's research on the tablets, I found that archaeologists believe they were chiseled by Ginn L. Irynkissgthie around the year 525 B.D.C. and archaeologists also believe the words spoke of future events.

I process all this data, and I believe they are about Pandora and that they are some sort of prophecy about her. Right now, I do not know their true meaning. One of the tablets is broken, and I do not know how much of the text is missing. I do not know if the two tablets go together or if they are part of a separate message. I return to the table. Pandora could be the Rushlight mentioned in the one and if so, she is some sort of destroyer.

I consider the warning about the destroyer and my suspicions that she is an organic-mecha. Is she a machine completely composed of lab-grown parts or is she a human with unique abilities? My new objective will be to discover the truth and once I find the truth, I will terminate Pandora.

End the Rogue's view...

The Rogue picked up the solder and continued the repair of its face and after some time, the Rogue turned its head side to side, examining its work. It was pleased with its repair and glanced at its left arm. The Rogue needed to fix the shoulder, so it removed its jacket, picked up a pair of needle nose pliers, inserted the head into a bullet hole, and clasped a 9 mm round. It pulled the bullet out, dropped the slug to a tray, and the parting gift from Pandora clanged on the metal. Black ooze ran down from the wound till the Rogue used the solder to stop the oil leak, and then it waved a scanner over the hole and examined the results on an H.H.C. Nothing more was damaged; it only needed to patch the hole, so it placed a piece of X-74 over the wound and soldered it in place. Once done, the Rogue moved its arm up and down. The repair wasn't bad, but its skin coloring was all wrong; it was too pale for what it needed.

It removed its Coffin Handled Bowie, placed the knife and sheath on the table, took off all its clothes, and stepped into a specially designed shower. The Rogue set a color knob on the wall to olive and turned it on, and dark dye sprayed from the shower head, darkening its skin and hair. The dye ran for several minutes until the coloring covered its entire body, and it turned off the shower and stepped to a drier in the back. The machine roared as hot air rushed over its body, setting the new color. The Rogue stepped out and studied itself in a full-length mirror, and then it studied its artificial eyes and the blood-red dot-light of its I-Link sensor. If it was to pass as a human, it would have to do something about them, so it removed the eye cover to the sensor input compartment by screwing it off. The Rogue placed the cover on the table, picked up the needle-nose pliers, and carefully removed the orange bulb from the compartment so that it would no longer blink and betray its true identity. It screwed the eye cover back on, walked over to the table with all the equipment, opened a container filled with lenses, selected brown, and inserted them.

The Rogue's view...

A question crosses my processor, so I go back to the bulb and study it. I remember in the past the dot-light blinking blood-red. The bulb is orange, so it could not possibly blink blood-red. It does not make sense, actually, a lot of things do not make sense, but time is short, and I will have to consider this mystery later.

End the Rogue's view...

It looked at its shabby business suit on the floor. The Rogue needed a change of clothes. It had to look the new part if it was going to investigate the stone tablets. It streaked its way to a locker room, used a master keycard it took off the body of a dead manager, opened lockers, and searched through clothing and personal items till it found what it needed. It put on a pitch-black business suit and studied itself in a full-length mirror. No one would know that it was an Un-Man, and it had one last room to visit before company showed up, so the Rogue made its way into the hall and down several passages. Hundreds of dead Factory techs and S.C.Ms. filled the war zone laden hallways. It had been over a week since the T-3s malfunctioned and killed almost everyone at the Factory. The Rogue searched several manager offices until it found one with a functioning computer, sat at the desk, and woke up the computer.

At the Factory's main gate...

Lieutenant Creed held up his hand as a convoy of eight trucks approached. He wore a jet-black uniform, and a handful of soldiers stood behind him. His men were armed with an FN SCARs (Fredricks of Noir's Sphinx Combat Assault Rifle). He and his men were part of the Third Branch Office's corporate military. The armored S.C.M. vehicles that had just pulled up belonged to the Council. The lead truck halted, and the driver who wore a dark green uniform looked over the Latino man in his late thirties with a black goatee. The driver noticed Creed's name on his uniform and his rank, and then he handed an H.H.C. to him.

"Lieutenant, I'm Lieutenant Walters." The red-headed man had a pale complexion and sported a high and tight crew cut and trimmed beard, and Walters spoke, "The Council will be taking over the Factory. You and your men are to return to the Third Branch Office for your new orders."

Creed slung his assault rifle over his shoulder, scanned the H.H.C., and told him, "Use caution. All of the T-3s may not have left the Factory. They're like the Rogue now, and they no longer follow orders."

"Thanks for the heads-up."

Walters slapped the side of the truck, and four Council S.C.Ms. jumped out of the back to guard the gate. The four men removed barricades from the back of a truck and set up a roadblock.

Walters ordered over the truck radio, "Move out!"

The convoy traveled down the long stretch of road toward two large buildings. The trucks halted, and Walters turned off the engine, opened the door, and jumped down from the vehicle. His men unloaded from the eight trucks, lined up in eight rows of ten, and stood at attention, holding their assault rifles across their chest.

Walters walked up and down the line, stopped, faced the men and women, and ordered, "Team leaders, move your soldiers out. I want the Factory secured and if you encounter any active Un-Men, do not engage. Radio in and wait for backup. Is that understood?"

"Yes, sir," the eight team leaders answered.
Chapter Six

Mr. Pinchbeck

2:16 P.M...

The Rogue worked on the computer with inhuman speed as the printer behind it spat out document after document. The Rogue took an ID badge from a dead body out in the hall, removed the card from the plastic covering, scanned it, and printed out a version with a black square instead of a photo. It snapped a picture of itself with a digital camera acquired from a locker, printed out the photo, pasted it to the ID, and put the new card back in the plastic covering. The Rogue clipped the ID to its pitch-black business suit. It finished its work, signed a few of the documents with the Sphinx Corporation President's signature it had copied from a document, placed them all in a folder, and then it made digital copies of all the documentation and placed them on an H.H.C.

All that was left to do was to set the stage, and it looked at a Sphinx Corporation credit card it stole from one Mr. Frank Bygone. It had all of its props but one, and a quick phone call from it would fix that. It picked up the receiver, heard the dial tone, and dialed a number it found on the internet.

"Hello," the Rogue said. "Yes, I would like to rent a limousine for the day. Yes, I will be paying with Corporate Credit. I would like to be picked up from the corner of Limit Street and West 1000 Avenue, and I will be there in three hours. Very good. Let me give you the Corporate Credit number."

The Rogue hung up once it was done; it would need to get out of the Factory without being spotted and make its way to Limit Street.

About four hours later...

The limo pulled up to the Factory's main gate. Two yellow and black striped barricades stood, blocking the entrance, and a Council S.C.M. approached the passenger's side door, keeping his XM8 at the ready. The Rogue would see if all its hard work had paid off, rolled down the tinted window, and waited to see what would happen; it was ready to draw its hidden knife at the slightest hint of failure.

The S.C.M. glanced around the limo's interior, then looked at what he believed was a man, and asked, "Can I help you?"

It had passed, and now it needed to start its performance, so the Rogue said, "I am Mr. Pinchbeck, and I am to take over management of the Factory for the Council. Here is my documentation."

It handed the S.C.M. an H.H.C., and the S.C.M. looked through the docs on the device and tapped his headset.

"Lieutenant, a Mr. Pinchbeck is at the gate. He claims he's the new manager of the Factory. Yes, sir. His paperwork is all in order. Yes, sir." The S.C.M. turned to the new manager and said, "Lieutenant Walters says for you to proceed in. He'll meet you at Building G, and he also wants me to ride along in case there are any Un-Men on the grounds."

"Certainly," the Rogue said. "Sit up front with the driver."

The S.C.M. relayed his orders to the remaining three, walked around the back of the vehicle, and entered through the front passenger door. The other S.C.Ms. removed the barricades blocking the entrance to the side, and the limo pulled down the road and after a short time, the vehicle stopped in front of Building G. Walters with a few of his men waited outside.

The Rogue got out of the limo, walked to the driver, and said, "You may return, and I will call if I need a ride."

The driver along with the S.C.M. still in the front headed for the main gate.

Walters walked to the new manager, offered his hand, and spoke, "Mr. Pinchbeck, welcome to the Factory." They shook, and then Walters removed an energy bar from his vest pocket and unwrapped the chocolate snack. "The Council sent you in a bit early." He took a bite and then said, "The dead have not been removed or the grounds secured."

"I am aware that cleanup has only started and know full well what to expect inside," the Rogue stated, then opened a folder on its H.H.C., and scanned through some of the files. "All I request from you is two of your soldiers till my own report in." It closed the folder and said, "I will not get in your way. I want to set up my office and begin work. There is so much data to catalog in the Factory. It will take us years to go through everything."

"I can loan you some soldiers," Walters said as he waved two of the S.C.Ms. forward and ordered them, "You two, go with Mr. Pinchbeck and stay with him until his people relieve you."

"Yes, sir!" the two men replied.

"This way gentlemen," it stated.

The Rogue headed into the Factory. The first part of its plan was complete; it had the Factory at its disposal. Now the Rogue must begin on the second part, and it would uncover everything the Factory had on Pandora and Ginn L. Irynkissgthie. The Rogue would determine if its drive was more than programming, unravel why it was fixated on killing Pandora and if that was its purpose in existence, it would destroy her.
Chapter Seven

Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo

Etymology, history and usage of the word asp...

Asp was originally a word for a venomous snake then later around 700 B.D.C. in slang, it referred to a person who was so low that they slithered on the ground. Over the centuries, the word also began to refer to a vain, self-important, silly, or aggressively stupid person, and the anus.

2:58 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Commercial Vicinage...

Katharine's view...

The corridors smell dusty and look as if no one has used them in years. A fluorescent light flickers overhead as we walk beneath a multitude of humming lights, and it's a maddening sound in the otherwise silent building of white block walls and concrete floors.

Kimberly brushes a cobweb out of the way as she complains, "All we've found are a few boxes of toys." She holds her gun at the ready as she questions, "Where's the lab?"

"You mean if this place has a lab," I tell her as even my optimism doubts its existence the more we explore this place. "The deeper we go the more I think Etna's only a distribution station. I don't think we'll find anything here. The Gorgons could just be a new line of toys Etna's developing."

"It's stupid comments like that that really pisses me off!" Kimberly yells at me as if the Assassins Guild Magistrates themselves ordered her to take her frustrations out on me. "You can't honestly think they're toys. For Ares' sake! Why would their file be on the Data Crystal? They have to be more than action figures."

"I know," I state. "But I can hope."

"You can hope? What kind of aspinine comment is that?" Kimberly asks me as she pauses at another door, opens it, and peers inside. "Don't you want to find something?" The room's empty like the three dozen or so we've already searched, and Kimberly says, "I do. It's the only reason I came. The info we downloaded from the Data Crystal has to have some importance. Otherwise, why would my mom have created the crystals and have hidden them?" She shuts the door and gripes, "Hades... I better not be wasting my time."

I mumble, "I really hate it when you yell at me."

"What did you say?"

I reply loudly, "I said..." I then speak normally, "I've been wondering what kind of project the Gorgons could be. I've encountered a lot of the Council's experiments over the past year, so I'm imagining the worst, and a toy sounds better than what I'm visualizing."

I'm serious. I would prefer the Gorgons to be a toy. In Greek stories, the Gorgons were three sisters so hideous the mere sight of them turned people into stone, so I know the Gorgons have to be weapons.

"You and your dream world," Kimberly complains. "You can't go by your imagination. You have to go by the facts, and then they'll lead you to the truth." She stops, faces me, and asks, "Did they do something to your mind when they experimented on you? Maybe they replaced it with the brain of a two-year-old."

Kimberly's view...

"That's kind of mean," that woman whines as if I've hurt her feelings. "Why would you say that?"

"Because you're an idiot," I tell her. "I've never seen somebody so naive."

She slowly blinks three times as if she's processing my statements and in that instance, I wonder if she is a machine. That woman might not have that light thingamajigger blinking some orange or red color declaring, 'Hey, I'm a bio-mecha', but she does have the feel of something that was made in a lab. No adult could act like she does.

"Naive? So you see me as a child?"

"Yes, a very annoying child," I answer her. "The world works certain ways, and you can't see it. Let me point out one example. You didn't want to kill the guard."

"What's wrong with that?"

"What's wrong with that? Oh, my Zeus! I can't believe you asked me that." I shake a condescending finger at her and say, "You're not understanding anything I'm telling you." I rub my temple, trying to reverse a headache that's setting in as I calmly say, "Oh, for Ares' sake... Never mind. Maybe you'll never understand. Come on."

Katharine's view...

I watch as Kimberly walks ahead of me. She is making fun of me. Kimberly can be real mean. I mumble, "I might be naive, but at least I'm not always angry."

"Did you say something?"

"Nothing," I reply, and then I hurry to catch up with her.

I don't believe murdering people's how this world is supposed to work and if it is, maybe it's better that I'm an idiot.

We hurry through the first section, enter the second, and come across a long hall with no doors. Blue pipes run along the ceiling and water beads on one of them and in places, the liquid falls to the concrete floor. We start through the passage. The blue-gray concrete corridor runs for about four hundred feet and goes around a corner, and then the corridor continues for another four hundred feet and ends at a door with no knob. On each side of the door is a scanner.

Kimberly's view...

I throw up my hands and exclaim, "Great, now what?" I go to the door and push up on it with my body as I state, "It won't budge. How are we going to get in?" I kick the door as if it's some flat tire, and then I stand back as if I'm thinking about ramming into it and say, "Maybe we should have brought the guard or we could have cut his hand off, and then we might have been able to use his palm print." That woman says nothing to my outburst and only stares at the scanners, so I say, "Well, we can't go any further." I start back through the corridor and order, "Let's return and see if we missed anything." I mumble, "Come back once I get a grenade launcher."

Katharine's view...

"Wait," I tell Kimberly as I glance at the star that marks my left palm. "I encountered a scanner like this at the Factory. I placed this on the scanner, and it let me in."

"Placed what?"

"This," I answer her as I show her the star that had been burned into my palm, and then I walk over to the machine on my right. I find an outline of a right hand on its glass top, so I move to the other machine, and it has an outline of a left hand. I place my palm on the scanner, and the device activates. It scans my hand with different bars of light like the one at the Factory.

"Ginn's Cipher detected. Activating micro-reader," the device states. "Access granted."

The door unlocks and slides up.

End Katharine's view...

The Sanctum...

Within the Chamber...

A female analyst turned from her workstation to the Council and yelled to them, "The door to Station Bravo has been activated."

"Bravo?" Ms. Nona inquired. "Which of our places is this?"

"It was our third lab," Mr. Decuma answered. "We long ago abandoned it once we finished the Gorgons experiment."

Ms. Nona stated, "I remember. Why would someone go there?"

"Why indeed?" Mr. Morta questioned. "Who accessed the lab?"

The female analyst turned back to her computer and read over the information, and then she uttered, "I don't think this can be right." The analyst checked the data again, then turned, and replied, "Sirs... Ma'am... The lab was accessed by Ginn's Cipher."

Ms. Nona questioned, "Are you sure?"

Back at Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo...

Kimberly's view...

"Let me see it," I order as I grab that woman's hand and turn it over. "It looks like..." I begin, and then I study my own right palm and compare the star burn on my hand to hers. "Oh, my Zeus... They're the same." I squeeze that woman's wrist and demand, "Where did you get it? Tell me! Tell me or so help me I'll–"

"You're hurting me. Let go," she yells as she tries to pull away.

"Not until you tell me where you received it!"

"The music box," that woman tells me, then reaches into her pocket with her other hand, and removes it. "I got it from the music box during my battle with the Un-Men. I was at Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse, a fire started, and the music box was in it and when I snatched it out of the flames to save it, it burned me." She stops resisting me and shows me the lid of the music box as she asks, "You remember, don't you? I had blisters on my hand when you took me to see Dr. Chiron," she adds as if that woman is still angry over the incident and the real reason I took her to the hospital.

"Let me see," I command, release her, take the music box, and examine the raised star on top. "It looks like the one. Yes, it's exactly like it, but how can it be?"

She rubs her wrist and asks, "Where did you get yours?"

I'm in deep thought and mumble, "Huh?"

"Where did you get your burn?"

"There was a fire in my mom's office the day she died. I grabbed the knob to go in and burned myself, and the star was on the knob." I glare at her, realizing I opened up to that woman, and I snap, "My past is none of your business."

She shrinks back from me as she asks, "Do you only know how to yell?"

I ignore her whining and study the star on my palm, and then I ask, "Do you know what they are?"

"The scanner at the Factory called it a cipher and beyond that, I don't know."

I place my thumb on one end of the music box and my index finger on the other as I say, "Let's see what we can find out." I direct my next word at the music box and speak, "Mom."

A 3-D image of Theresa Griffin generates in front of me. The hologram, who has an L-A processor and can Learn and Adapt, depending on her surroundings, scans the area and asks, "Where are we?"

"Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo," that woman answers. "The address you decoded from the Data Crystal. Do you–"

"Enough with her questions. I want you to answer mine," I insist as I show the hologram my palm and inquire, "What is this star? Why do I and that woman have it? And don't tell me you don't know."

"I see you are in a good mood today," the hologram says and examines the burn. "I do not believe it. The mark is Ginn's Cipher."

"Ginn?" I repeat.

"Yes, Ginn L. Irynkissgthie."

"Isn't he the composer of Unfinished Melody?" that woman asks as she points to the music box.

"Yes," the hologram answers. "The star looks like the cipher Ginn mentioned in his works."

Katharine's view...

I peer over Kimberly's shoulder so I can look at the hologram, and I ask, "Do you know what the star is?"

"Yes, I was able to decode more of the files I uploaded from the Data Crystal. Ginn's Cipher was one of them."

"Wait. Let's go back a bit," Kimberly says. "You mentioned Ginn's Works. What are you talking about? I thought he only composed the one melody and never finished it. Are there more?"

Kimberly's view...

"You are correct. There is only the one," the hologram answers. "Though, there is a rumor he had completed... Never mind. It is only a rumor but as I was saying, Ginn did create other things. He was not only a composer but an inventor, painter, sculptor, philosopher, scientist, and prophet. I have not been able to decode all the information on the file but this is what I know. Ginn's Cipher or the Star Cipher has some code or other researchers believe a map to–"

"Kimberly," that woman interrupts, putting her hand to her chest as if she has heartburn.

"Can't you see I'm talking?" I yell at her. "Hades! Sometimes you can be so rude."

"I'm not the one who's barging in on our party," that woman tells me as she turns, facing the way she and I came in with this look of worry. "They're coming. Bio-mechas." Her eyes erupt with that hellish blue glow that makes me cringe as she quickly removes her backpack and pulls out the gun I loaned her as she warns again, "They're coming!" She drops the bag, unsets the safety, and raises the PPK, and shouts, "Get ready!"
Chapter Eight

Guardians Of Etna

3:31 P.M...

Katharine's view...

There were few things I awoke with at Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse over a year ago, and my memory wasn't one of them. I do have this ability that can detect bio-mechas and once an active bio-mecha enters the perimeter of my ability, I know their distance, their model, and how many there are. I like to call it my own spider-sense.

Kimberly's view...

"Great. Just great!" I yell as I cringe at the word bio-mecha. "How did they find you this time? I thought they couldn't after Brian removed your tracking beacon." I decide I can't be chit-chatting, so I tell the hologram, "We'll talk later."

"Till then..." the hologram says and deactivates as the two blue squares on the music box fade to the silver metal surface.

"I hate robots," I state as if I have to, and then I hand the music box back to that woman and ready my weapon. "Hades... I really hate them. What about my question? Are they Un-Men?"

"No, they're K-99s and there are about a dozen of them," that woman replies as she places the music box in her pocket, grabs the backpack, and slings it over her shoulder. "And they didn't track me down. They were most likely positioned here to guard Etna."

I glance at the corridor we had come through, then into the passage the door opened into, and ask, "Which way are they coming?" I recall our last encounter with bio-mechas and how the T-3s nearly killed us when we were at the Factory and would have if not for Lieutenant Creed and his men coming to our rescue.

"They're coming the way we came in," that woman answers as she aims down the long stretch of hall.

She doesn't seem worried. That woman had mentioned in the time before meeting me, she had encountered many types of bio-mechas and only the Rogue made her afraid. The Rogue also sends fear rampaging through my heart but that doesn't mean I'm any less afraid of the other types.

That woman informs me, "They'll turn the corner in about forty seconds. Go on. I can handle them."

"I don't think so!" I yell. "I won't have you run off and leave me alone with the tin freaks. When it comes to killing, I'll handle my share. You see as a Closer I have my honor to think of."

"Honor..?" that woman repeats as if it should be a word foreign to me.

I ignore what she implies. I do have my honor, and I can't have someone stepping in for me. I'm not the type of person to owe anyone anything. I rely on myself and no one else. I reflect on my recent past. No one has been there for me and no one will be, so I have to do it myself.

I move to the other side of the hall beside that woman, aim where she does, and question, "Do we kill the K-99s like the Un-Men?"

Katharine's view...

"No, you need to shoot them in the right eye to disable this line of bio-mechas so aim carefully," I answer.

I can tell Kimberly's starting to trust me. Yeah right! Our partnership's not turning out like I imagined, but I shouldn't expect too much. Kimberly's an assassin. I don't think they can trust anyone.

I glance at her... Maybe I just don't understand Kimberly. She has to feel isolated and alone, and maybe that's why she's always so angry. Her world must be so dark.

End Katharine's view...

The K-99s turned the corner. They were of great size. The height of their shoulders was 34 inches, and they weighed 220 pounds. Their creators combined power and swiftness with keen sensors. The K-99s were modeled after the largest and tallest of the galloping hounds, and they had a rough steel-gray coat and were Greyhound-like. They carried their head and neck high, and their tail had an upward sweep with a slight curve toward the extremity. The K-99s panted as they charged, mimicking their canine archetypes.

Katharine's view...

I look at their leader and notice something I didn't expect and utter, "The K-99s are wearing protective steel visors! We won't be able to shoot their kill switch." I lift my gun and without another thought, I dart for the door behind us as I scream, "Run!"

"Run..?" Kimberly shouts over her shoulder as I flee past her. "I never thought you were a coward."

"Hurry!" I insist. "They're wearing visors. We can't take them down." In a panic, I enter the next passage, turn, and wave for Kimberly as I yell again, "Run!" The K-99s are halfway through the corridor, so I start to run again, hoping she'll follow as I scream, "We need to find a place they can't get to!"

Kimberly joins me, and we bolt through the passage. The concrete floor we run across descends and ends, and it's replaced by a sandy one. We run down it with the K-99s gaining on us, and the passage ends in a large cave with a second level floor curved above us. Three other passages leave the cave.

"Now what?" Kimberly questions.

"Climb!" I command as I tuck the gun and start scaling the pitted stone wall.

Kimberly places her gun in her shoulder holster and follows. We're about ten feet up when the K-99s reach the cave, and the pack circles under us. The leader leaps up, snaps at Kimberly's heel, and barely misses her. Kimberly lurches up, startled by the large mouth, loses her footing, and slips. I quickly grab her wrist, and she dangles above the K-99s.

"Oh, my Zeus!" Kimberly shouts. "Don't drop me! Get me up!"

"Crap!" I utter as I strain to keep from dropping her as I dig my nails into the cliff. "I can't. I don't have the strength." I swing her to the rock face as I tell her, "You'll have to reestablish your footing." I grunt for the strain to my arm as I add, "And hurry. You're not exactly light."

All the K-99s bark and growl as a few continue leaping for us.

Kimberly frantically searches the rough surface with her free hand as I desperately swing her over, but she can't find a holding. She swings backward, and we try again and on her third swing over, she finds a grip and her footing and yells, "Got it!"

"Thank goodness," I say as I release her wrist. "I couldn't hold you up much longer."

Kimberly climbs higher and then glares down at me as she questions as if it's more important than anything else, "What was that about my weight?"

"Ah, nothing..." I reply as I swallow hard, burning under the fury of the Phoenix's fiery gaze. "It was nothing."

"That's what I thought," Kimberly speaks and then continues climbing.

Once we're higher, the K-99s give up their jumping, and then the twelve K-99s stare at one another and calculate their next move. They must agree on a plan and split up into two groups. The first group continues into one of the cave's passages while the other group goes back the way they came in.

Kimberly reaches the second story, drags herself up, and wipes sand off her black clothes as she questions, "What are they doing?"

"Umm..." I start as I struggle to reach the top. I glance down and quickly look up as I start to lose my hold, and then I ask, "Could you give me a hand? I don't know if I can pull myself up. I'm pretty tired after holding up your heavy... umm... after holding you up."

Kimberly's view...

I walk to the edge and put my hands on my hips, thinking I'd get right on it. If that woman thinks I'm going to help her, she better get it straight right now, I'm only looking out for myself. She better do the same thing.

"Your hand, please," that woman pleads with me. "I think I'm about to fall."

I don't move as I inquire, "What about my question?"

Katharine's view...

Kimberly isn't going to help me, and I panic as I glance down. I doubt she'll even attempt to save me if I fall. I slowly drag myself up as my arms tremble with the effort, and then I pull myself high enough to lay half my body over the ledge. I don't think she would have, and our partnership seems more and more one-sided.

"Well..." Kimberly taps her foot and inquires, "My question?"

"Right." I exhale, creating a mini dust cloud over the sandy floor. "Your question."

I cough and rest a few more seconds. I'm not Kimberly's partner... I'm her punching bag. She's using me, and she's not hiding it at all.

I'm finally able to catch my breath enough to answer her and say, "The K-99s are tracking us and most likely have the floor plans of this facility and are finding the best way to hunt us down."

"Well, you better get off your lazy asp and get moving." Kimberly scans the second level and adds, "No time to lie around."

I moan, roll long ways, take a couple more seconds to catch my breath, stand, and glare at her. I can't understand why Kimberly treats me this way. It's like she wants me to die. It's probably because it will save her from having to close me later. I'm feeling less and less secure in our partnership.

Looking at one end of the curved walkway and then to the other, Kimberly says, "I see a door."

She rushes to it around the sandy floor, and I follow. I can't believe Kimberly stood there and watched me struggle like a bug with its legs torn off.

Kimberly tries the knob and then tells me, "It's locked." She examines the keyhole. "I should be able to pick it."

Rage moves within me like a caged tigress as I silently watch Kimberly from behind, and the intensifying anger consumes my mind; it has been a long time since I felt this mad. Kimberly didn't help me. We're supposed to be partners. I could have fallen and died. I feel my eyes crackle with electricity and see their blue hue reflect off the sand around me as my anger keeps the Beta Phase active. I watch Kimberly remove a small kit from her knapsack. I think she wanted me to fall. I fist my right hand, thinking over the possibility, and the Ult L-E glows brighter like the torch of a welder. I think she plans on killing me once she finds who murdered her mom. I remove my own PPK and unlock the safety, deciding I can't take it anymore and need to act.

Not realizing what's going on behind her, Kimberly kneels and starts to lift her tools to the knob. "I'll have it open in no–"

I raise the gun. Kimberly will... I focus on the back of her head. Kimberly will kill me. I take aim as my rage increases. She won't treat me like this again. I swear to myself that I won't let Kimberly end me as I feel something new take hold.

Kimberly's view...

I'm focusing on the lock I have to pick but for some reason, I turn and look at that woman. Time slows and I feel fear envelop me. Her eyes flicker with surges of purple electricity fighting with the demon-blue light that already consumes her eyes as if they're on fire. The new Ult L-E clashes with the old like two dragons seeking dominance, and then the purple wins the battle and consumes her gaze in a horrid glow. I thought her face couldn't become anymore frightening, but then a blood-red electricity surges within the purple, and the blood-red electricity devours the purple as she makes a declaration to me.

"I won't let you do it!"

I believe I'm seeing my end as that woman fires. The empty shell ejects from the gun as she shoots again. The first shell clangs to the floor and the second follows. She fires two more times without pausing.

I gasp as the bullets whizz by inches from my face, and I instinctively go for my gun. I stop before drawing my weapon. The bullets slam into the knob and with a frustrated yell, she kicks in the door and the frame splinters. She walks by me and glowers at me with eyes that caution, and they caution that she'll only put up with so much. That woman has been mistreated enough.

Hades! I see more in her stare, and it warns me that she won't let me kill her, not without a fight. I get the message and her eyes... They're on fire. I've never seen them that way before.

That woman walks in about ten feet, stops, and turns and by then, her demeanor has completed a one-eighty. Her hazel eyes no longer crackle with blood-red Ult L-E or look provoked as she says, "Come on, there's no time to be sitting around on your lazy asp."

What do I see in that woman's eyes? Is it the look of innocence or is it a childlike facade hiding a dark purpose? Whatever I see, I have to be more careful. What do I really know about her? She could be a vicious tigress hiding inside a kitten.
Chapter Nine

The Furies

3:41 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Lieutenant Creed approached a secretary at the Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office and stated, "I have an appointment with the Chairman."

Cathy looked up and greeted, "Good afternoon, Lieutenant Creed. Go right in, Mr. Griffin is expecting you."

Creed glanced at the waiting room, saw no one there, and made his way down the hall and once he arrived, he knocked on the door and entered the huge corner office.

Mr. Griffin sat at his desk, working on his computer and said, "Lieutenant, come in. Have a seat."

Creed closed the door then went and sat, and then he asked, "Do you have new orders for my unit, sir?"

"Actually..." Mr. Griffin began as he grabbed an H.H.C. from his desk and handed it to him. "I'm disbanding your unit. Here are the orders."

Creed stood, shouting, "I don't understand. My unit is the most efficient–"

"Lieutenant," Mr. Griffin interrupted. "Your unit is efficient and that is precisely why I am disbanding it."

Confused about what he had been told, Creed took the device, sat, opened the file, and scanned the document.

Mr. Griffin continued, "I want you to assemble a special task force under my control." He faced the desktop computer and typed a few things, and then he stated, "I want you to select only the best of your officers. Ones you can trust." He turned his attention back to him and spoke, "Then I want you to go into the Third Branch Office S.C.M. files and find other highly qualified men and women. This task force will be under your command, and you'll report only to me."

"Sir?"

"I'll need to run Ultra-black Operations. Orthos and his security force are fine for internal matters, and the S.C.Ms. aren't specialized enough for what I'm wanting. I would like you to find the elite in every field. You'll have all the funding you'll need, and you can use Sub-level 120 of this building as your base of operations."

"What name will this task force operate under?"

"You'll be called the Furies."

"Furies," Creed repeated then grinned, pleased with the name.

Mr. Griffin pushed back from the desk and ordered, "Begin putting the task force together tonight. I need the Furies operational in less than a week. Cathy can assist you with any outside resource that you'll need to get your base ready." He paused, opened a desk drawer, and removed a box that fit in his palm as he said, "One other thing. I'm promoting you to captain."

He handed the lieutenant the box with the new insignia pins.

"I don't know what to say," Creed replied, took the box, and stated, "Thank you, sir."

The phone rang.

"Please excuse me, lieutenant... Actually, I should say captain." Mr. Griffin answered the phone, "Yes, Cathy."

She told him, "Orthos is here. He says he has the files from the Second Branch Office."

"Yes, the ones the Vice President wanted to send over. Have the Head of Security come in."

"At once, Mr. Griffin," Cathy spoke and then hung up.

Mr. Griffin told Creed, "You have your orders, captain. That's all."

Creed stood and saluted as he said, "Yes, sir."

He left and passed Orthos who entered the Chairman's office, carrying about a dozen folders.

Mr. Griffin waited till his Head of Security entered and then questioned him, "Did you have any problems at the Second Branch Office?"

"No," Orthos answered as he placed the folders on the desk. "The Vice President showed no hostility. He seemed eager for you to have these, and he said they are from when you were Head of Security here and he was the Chairman."

"It was a very long time ago," Mr. Griffin spoke mostly to himself as he stared at the files, wondering why the Vice President would send them now, and then he looked at Orthos and questioned, "Did the Vice President say anything?"

"Only that he thought he might have some more files. He told me I should stop by later and pick them up."

"Do so and watch yourself."

"Yes, Chairman," Orthos replied and then made his way out.

Mr. Griffin's view...

I stand, pick up the folders, then go and lie on my dark brown leather couch, and flip through them till something catches my eye. I sit up in disbelief and read it again. It can't be right! According to the files, I have another child and the revelation is like an earthquake toppling the world on top of me.

I flip back a few pages. I thought the child died during delivery, but not according to these records. Hades! I slam my fist on the couch. The corporation lied to me, and they dared take my child away!
Chapter Ten

New Neighbor

4:01 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

An unmarked white delivery van rumbled down West 1000 Avenue, drove into Nexus Apartments parking garage, and stopped at the entrance. Zax removed a card from his shirt pocket, swiped it on a scanner, and then waited as a gate slid open. Security cameras monitored the entrance and all of the garage, and a security guard manned each level. Zax drove past the gate and up a few ramps, parked on level four, and stepped down from the vehicle; he wore a white delivery uniform and cap. Zax unloaded a few boxes from the back of the van onto a pushcart, started toward the elevator, went up to the thirty-first floor, and made his way to Apartment G.

In front of the door, he cleared his throat before saying, "Door, unlock."

"Voice recognized as Zax Olympus," A.C.S. stated in a female voice. "Opening door."

The apartment door slid sideways, and he walked in the small entry, pushing the cart and commanded, "Door lock."

The door shut.

"Welcome to your home, Mr. Olympus," A.C.S. stated. "The staff and management of Nexus Apartments hope your stay with us will be enjoyable."

"Thanks."

Zax glanced around and noticed that the apartment's layout was the opposite of its neighbor H. The entry emptied into an open kitchen with black marble counters and stainless steel appliances. He pushed the cart into the living room off to the right, paused from his work, and walked to the kitchen's window to look over West 1000 Avenue. Black rain fell on the street below. He had made it in before the Tainted Rainstorm. He glanced around the kitchen and realized that he should have bought some groceries. It looks like he'll be living on takeout. He saw a note and a remote on the kitchen's counter, and Zax read the note that was from the manager of Nexus Apartments.

"Welcome to your new home. If you need anything, don't hesitate to contact me. The remote will work the TV and radio and as you instructed, the apartment is fully furnished. Enjoy your stay."

He picked up the remote and muttered, "A fruit basket would have been nice. I'm starved."

He clicked on the TV and went to work unloading the boxes.

Anchorwoman Linda Harvey with NBS reported, "Today's top story. The Jackal an Illicit Closer was captured early this morning by Noir Civil Police Force. The N.C.P.F. at this time has given no details as to the identity of this killer, and the illegal assassin is thought to have murdered over thirty people in the Hellenistic Sector. It is believed the Assassins Guild will ask for the death penalty if the Jackal is found guilty. The Jackal is accused of killing without a license. We will update you as this story progresses." Linda switched camera view, and then she stated, "We have an update on the Un-Men attacks we aired two days ago. The Sphinx Corporation has taken full blame for this line of bio-mechas and will compensate for all losses of life and property. Sphinx assures the population that this model of Un-Men has been recalled and will be destroyed. For more information, we now go to Frank Trepit who is standing by for a press conference."

The scene switched to a noisy room crowded with chairs. Reporters and representatives from other corporations filled the seats and in the back of the room, a man with a mic looked at the camera.

"Thank you, Linda. The conference is about to start. We'll be seeing Sphinx's new Press Secretary. She took over the position on Thursday which was less than twelve hours ago. She..." Frank glanced at the front of the room and he said, "Here she comes now."

A woman with shoulder length auburn hair and wearing a dark blue business suit walked to a podium, and she waited till the room quieted down and then said, "Hello everyone. Many of you may not know me, I'm Jane Speer. I'm the new Press Secretary for Sphinx's Third Branch Office." Jane looked at an H.H.C. she carried and then she continued, "I would like to first assure those in Noir that the rogue Un-Men have been eliminated. There's no need for worry." She paused and emphasized the next statement as she spoke, "I would also like to add that the technicians who looked over the T-3s programming believe the project was sabotaged by a rival corporation."

The room erupted with chatter as reporters raised their hands and shouted questions at Ms. Speer.

Zax changed the channel as he muttered, "The news is depressing and full of lies."

The bounty show Show Me The Money! was wrapping up with some final words from its host, Karen Miles.

"All right viewers, if you have seen any of these people call the number you see on the screen to..."

The TV audience shouted with her, "Show Me The Money!"

The credits rolled and another bounty show called Easy Money! started.

He turned the TV off. There was nothing on but the news and bounty shows. One would think they would try putting something on the tube that was entertaining. Maybe a show about heroes. It would never happen, not on this planet. Maybe he'd listen to music, so Zax clicked the radio on with the remote and tuned it into a classical station.

Within an hour, he unloaded the boxes and set up tables and equipment to monitor Apartment H next door. He placed all the tables and equipment in the Master Bedroom, he even purchased and had delivered a second large flat screen TV and hung it in the bedroom. He had it put there in case he wanted to watch the news. He removed a cell phone.

"This is Delivery Man, connect me to R.G.," Zax began and then paused, waiting for his mysterious boss to pick up the line. "I have set up surveillance. I entered Apartment H yesterday while they were out and placed the devices, and I have cameras looking in on the kitchen and the living room. I have even tapped into the building's security and have a visual of the hall." He glanced at all the monitors and stated, "At the moment, Kimberly and Katharine aren't at home." He listened to his boss and then replied, "Yep. Yep. I'll submit daily emails on the two. Yep. I understand. If something out of the ordinary happens, I'm to contact you immediately but for now, I'm to stay at Stage One surveillance. Understood, Delivery Man out."
Chapter Eleven

Where Is Pandora?

Neon signs and flickering street lights cast a dim glow on Wayfaring Lane as Dry Clouds roared and growled overhead like a wrath-filled beast. Tainted Rain fell from the menacing sky, speckling the streets and people with black drops, and soon the storm left the area, leaving behind an oily residue. A street clock chimed five times as evening approached. Without clocks, no one would know if it was morning, afternoon, or night. Stephanie walked through Wayfaring Lane; it was a street made famous in the Hellenistic Sector, Old Business Vicinage for its unscrupulous activities. She had shoulder length blonde hair, wore jeans and a black printed t-shirt of a smiley face, and passed many people lining the street. They sold canned food, Transgenic Vegetables, and used clothes, and a few bartered flesh, Sunna Snaps, and/or stolen water ration cards. The streets were crowded. Some of the people wore Winnow Masks, marking them as immigrants to the Dark Half of the planet, but most of the people didn't wear the air filters, having lived in Noir long enough for their lungs to become accustomed to the pollutants. Stephanie paused and adjusted the bright yellow backpack on her shoulders. She didn't wear a mask.

A Street Sanitizer activated once the Tainted Rainstorm passed and as the loud automatized machine rumbled down the potholed road, she quickly crossed the street ahead of the machine. Stephanie paused at the sidewalk and turned, watching the Street Sanitizer. She had wondered how they got rid of all this oily muck and shifted the pack on her back. She couldn't understand why anyone would want to live in the Dark Half and yet... Stephanie grinned, thinking of the twenty-four-hour clubs she visited and the men there who satisfied her in carnal ways. Eternal darkness did have its perks. She made her way to a shelter called the Kitchen and went into the office, and she waited a few minutes before a man came in.

"Can I help you?" he asked, carrying a sack of Chinese takeout.

"Yes, I'm looking for my sister," Stephanie answered as she reached into the backpack, pulled out an H.H.C., and showed the man a photo on the screen. "Have you seen her?"

"Let me see." He took the device, looked at the picture, and then answered, "Yeah." He shook his finger at the photo and said, "Her name was Katie... No, wait. Kat, I think. She hung around Preacher a lot." He handed the small computer back as he stated, "He used to run this shelter."

"Where can I find this preacher? Is he at a church or a temple somewhere?"

The man shook his head and answered, "He wasn't a real preacher; it was his name around here." The man removed the food from the sack and placed it on the desk. "Anyway, Preacher's dead." He opened up the sweet and sour chicken as he stated, "He was killed over a week ago. He was gunned down right outside. They say it might have been the work of an Illicit Closer."

"Oh. Do you know of anyone else who might know this woman... Ah... I mean my sister or where I might find her?"

"No," he replied as he removed chopsticks from the sack and broke them apart. "But they're holding Preacher's funeral tomorrow." He grabbed a piece of chicken with the chopsticks, shoved it into his large toothy orifice, and continued talking with food in his mouth. "Maybe she'll show. Here..." He scribbled down an address on a napkin. "This is where it'll be."

Stephanie's view...

"Thanks."

I take the paper, grab my bag, and walk out of the office, reading the napkin. It looks like it will be tomorrow. I put a hand to my chest as my heart races. I've never been this excited. I can't wait to meet... What did he call her? Kat... I'm looking forward to meeting Kat and proving myself.

I wave for a taxi. The Council's sending its best wishes and tomorrow Pandora will meet Cerberus.

* * *

6:09 P.M...

The Chamber...

A male analyst noticed a change in Pandora's bio-data, and he waved over a supervisor.

"Yes," she inquired.

"Look at this." The analyst pointed to his computer's screen as he stated, "Something's going on with Pandora; its readings are off the chart."

"Let me see. Hmm... The data can't be right; it's probably a receiver hiccup. I want you to make a note of it though but remember, the Council deemed Pandora a failure. Let's keep our focus on Cerberus unless something drastic changes."

"I understand."

"All right then. Back to work."
Chapter Twelve

Another Room

6:11 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Commercial Vicinage...

Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo...

Kimberly's view...

The door that woman kicked in opens into a large room filled with about a hundred filing cabinets, and it's apparent the room hasn't been used in years.

That woman tells me, "Come on, there's no time to be sitting around on your lazy asp."

I stop staring at her, focus on what needs to be done, and hurry in past her, and then that woman glances outside before shutting the door. I search the room over the barrel of my PPK and lower the gun after finding no threat.

That woman walks over to a filing cabinet with an old metal surface and opens the top drawer of five, and it squeaks as she does so.

"They're a little rusty. They've been in here a long time," she states as she turns back to me. "What do you think?"

"They're old but–" I start as I can't shake what happened at the door. I thought I was facing a terrifying demon but as I look at her now, it's almost like... a sense of fondness and loss sweeps over me and I think of a kitty cat I once had and lost.

"Is everything alright?" that woman questions me, interrupting my thoughts.

I force all the confusing fear and misplaced familiarity to the back of my mind to worry about later, move to a filing cabinet, and finish what I was saying earlier by questioning, "–is there anything useful in them?" I order her as if I need to take back my leadership in our roles, "Go through the ones on your side, and I'll do the same, and maybe we'll get lucky and find something."

"First, I need to come down," that woman tells me as if making up some excuse to be lazy, then she closes her eyes as if viewing security footage on the back of her eyelids, and states, "The K-99s are nowhere near us so now would be the best time."

She moves away from the filing cabinets, finds a place to sit on the floor near the door, removes the music box from her pocket, and opens its lid.

"Maybe now isn't the best time for you to go into your... Umm... Whatever you call it."

"The Drifting Time," that woman replies as she closes the lid to the music box. "The K-99s are beyond the range of my senses, so I should use this time to come down from the Ultra-Epi. Who knows when I'll get another chance?" She assures me, "I'll wake up when I sense them and if there's some other type of trouble, just give me a good shake."

I think about giving her a real good shake and then maybe beating that woman before I question her, "Come down? You make it sound like you're on drugs. Are you a junkie like those Sunna Snap addicts?"

"No, it's nothing like that," she answers, and then she tries to explain by saying, "If I don't listen to the music and calm down, I get anxious and sometimes I get these really bad headaches." She pauses as if thinking back to other instances, and then she says, "I've gone a long time without the music and without coming down and I've gotten the shakes."

"You went into withdrawal. It still sounds like you're an addict," I state as I walk to the first filing cabinet, put my hand on top, and stare at the dust. "Have you ever seen the junkies on Wayfaring Lane?"

"Yes, and I never thought of myself that way," she replies, and then that woman looks at the music box as if it holds some sort of answers that it's keeping from her. "Who knows what the Council did to me?" She turns and states, trying to convince me, "If I don't come down, I'm no use to you and trust me, you're going to need me. It won't take long."

There's that word again... Trust... It proves that woman has learned nothing from before. What will I have to do to get it through her thick skull that no one can be counted on for anything?

"Go ahead," I tell her, granting my permission for her to be a freak. "I'm tired of hearing you whine. I'll start on the filing cabinets." I open a drawer and add, "But before you take your nappy-poo, I have one more question for you. Do you have to do this every time you see any action?" I find nothing and close the drawer as I say, "Waiting on you could get old very quick."

"Yes, every time the Ultra-Epi kicks in but only bio-mechas trigger it," that woman answers and after a few seconds, she adds like some scolded child, "I'm sorry."

"What are you sorry for?" I question as I focus more on what I'm searching for than what she's whining about now.

"That I'm a bother. That I'm..." She stares at the floor and after a few seconds, she says, "I'm sorry that I'm not normal."

"I don't know why you're apologizing. It's not like you can help it," I tell her and then I mutter, "You little freak."

"Still... I'm sorry."

"Well... As long as it doesn't get us killed, don't worry about it," I state as I start on the third cabinet. A few moments go by, and then I say, "I've been meaning to ask you something. Is the Ultra-Epi what causes your eyes to glow?"

"Yes, of what I've been able to find out it is."

That woman's definitely a little freak. I can't wait till I don't need her help anymore and I can close her. I just need to make sure I come up with a story that will be believable when I report her accidental death to Voice.

I glance at her and see that she's staring at me, so I tell her, "Well, hurry up and get your nappy-poo over." I think about what she has told me, and I add, "And you better not be giving me a line of Cretan Bull so that you can get out of working."

I force a smile to hide what I'm really thinking. I don't like being in this stupid and weird partnership. I'm more of a loner. People just get in the way, and I just know that woman's going to cause me a lot of paperwork once I do close her.

Katharine's view...

"I shouldn't be out for long," I tell Kimberly.

I open the music box, and the tune plays, and soon I fall asleep and enter the Drifting Time. Moments pass and then an image of a bearded man appears before me as he speaks to me in my dream.

"My dear, you must remember."

I'm not sure what he wants me to remember but whatever it is... it seems very important to him.

"My dear, remember the poem."

"What poem?" I question.

He says with a soothing voice, "Though the clouds darken the sun..."

His words trigger something within me, and I mutter the rest of the poem and once I finish, he desperately beseeches me once again.

"My dear, you must remember the rest."

"I don't know the rest."

"You must try," he urges me as if people are in danger and only I can save them by speaking what I don't know.

I'm starting to feel uncomfortable in my dream. I want to know who this man is who keeps insisting I know things that I don't. I also want to know why he speaks to me like he knows me. Is he real or something my mind has created just to fill my confused and muddled mind? I'm not afraid of him, and I do get this sense that he wants to help.

I think I should listen to him, so I tell him, "I'll try." I calm myself and then focus on what I need to do. I must remember... I must remember something I don't seem to know. I try with all my being, but I can't remember anything past the words that I do know and after some time, I give up and tell him, "I can't find the words. Are you sure there's more?"

He doesn't answer me.

"Hello... Are you still there? Hello..?"

The dream fades, and I continue through the Drifting Time. I find that I want to go back to that dream. I want to remember what I can't but those thoughts fade as dreams do, and I have no other strange encounters.

After about ten minutes...

I open my eyes and find Kimberly's still looking for clues, so I close the lid to the music box, and the noise of grinding filing cabinet drawers becomes the dominant sound. I stand, grab my backpack, start on my side of the room, go through drawer after drawer, and find them empty. I pause and shout to Kimberly who's standing at the other end of the room, "Find anything?"

"No," she yells back, closes the last drawer on her side, and leans against the filing cabinet. "You took a short nap."

"I said it would be. Did you doubt me?"

Kimberly's view...

"Always have and–" I tell that woman as I walk over to the left side of the room and start on her cabinets so that we can be done with this room, "–always will." We go through a few more drawers, and then I tell her, "I'm beginning to think this trip was a waste of time. The only thing we've accomplished is getting my asp nearly nipped off." I mutter, "And I saw a demon I wish I never saw." I open another drawer, pause from my search, and ask her, "Do you know you talk in your sleep?"

"Really..?" that woman replies. "What did I say?"

The lights flicker and the power goes off, plunging the room into darkness and within a few seconds, the emergency lights come on and cast the area in a green glow.

"A blackout?" I question.

"Maybe not," that woman answers as she moves to the front door, listens at the door frame, then comes back, and tells me, "The K-99s may have knocked out the power if they feel it's the only way to defend this building."

I remove my gun and ask, "Do you think they know where we are?"

"They're probably making their way here now."

"Great!" I shout as I throw up my hands. "Just great! How are we..?"

"Look," that woman interrupts me as she points to the floor at the back wall. "I see a light."

I move to the rear of the room and that woman follows me, and I stare at the floor as a white light glows through a small crack.

"Is it another room?" I ask, and then I push on the wall and a concealed door opens. I don't want to go in first. Actually, I don't want to go in at all, so I turn back to that woman and ask, "What do you think? Should we go in or run? The K-99s could be here at any moment and we only have one way out of this room that I can see." I glance back into the next room and add, "Hades... It could be another waste of my time to search this next room."

"We've come this far."

"I was thinking the same thing," I tell her, hating that she's right, and then I reluctantly start through first. "Come on, let's try to salvage the trip."
Chapter Thirteen

Children of Nyx

6:48 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Commercial Vicinage...

Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo...

Katharine's view...

We walk through the concealed door and find a brightly lit room with beige carpeting. The second room feels different than the first; it feels even less used when the facility was in operation. A bookshelf full of volumes is against the right wall, and a single filing cabinet is against the left wall. I move to the lone cabinet and open the top drawer through the fourth, finding them empty, then I open the last drawer, and I find that it's also empty. I start to shut it but then I see a corner of a filing folder that has fallen underneath. I remove the bottom drawer from the cabinet, set it to the side, grab the file, and start glancing through it and while I do that, Kimberly goes over to the bookshelf, grabs a book, and flips through the pages, searching for anything of interest. Once she's done, Kimberly drops the book to the floor and starts on another.

Kimberly has made a small pile by the time she asks me, "Did you find anything?"

"Yes," I answer as I walk to the center of the room. "I've found a file that appears to have been lost."

"When..?"

"I'm not sure when it was lost."

Kimberly snaps at me, "I'm not asking when it was lost. I was going to ask you when you were going to tell me you found it!"

"Why are you yelling at me?" I shout back at her. "I don't remember yelling at you."

"You might not have yelled at me, but you nearly shot my head off!"

"So that's why you're mad at me," I tell her as I lower my voice back down. "How do you think I feel when you didn't help me to the top when we were climbing? I just saved your life, and you couldn't even lend me a hand. We're supposed to be partners."

Kimberly stares at me as if I've got horns growing out of my head.

"I think I understand," I tell her as I feel myself growing angrier by the word. "We don't really have a partnership. You're here for yourself and that's it, and when you don't need me anymore you're going to..."

"For Ares' sake!" Kimberly yells at me. "Just tell me what's in the file!"

She doesn't want this discussion. I don't think Kimberly will ever want this discussion, so I sigh, then scan over the first three sheets again, and reply, "The first part is about a Greek Goddess and the file explains how Nyx is the Goddess of Night." I turn to the fourth, fifth, and sixth sheets and then I say, "Some of the information are blacked out. This next part talks about the Children of Nyx, and here's a blacked out area ending with that Nemesis is Retribution and Eris is Strife." I flip to the seventh sheet and say, "This page talks about an experiment." I read further, and then I utter, "I don't believe it."

"What is it?" Kimberly asks as she moves from the shelf to my side so she can also peer at the file.

I tell her, "The Council was the ones involved with organic-mecha."

The Council... My anger returns as I think about them. They're the ones who had me... They're the ones who are still testing me... I think about what this discovery means and if it's true, if they were the ones involved with organic-mecha, could they be the ones who made me? They've had me, so they must know what I am. They've probably known all along what I am and that infuriates me. They should have told me. They should tell me who or what I am. I glance up at Kimberly who's giving me this weird look, and I know that I can't think this way. I can't doubt my humanity but I do. At the slightest mention of organic-mecha, I'm all freaked out that I am one, that I am this thing created in a lab. I can't do this to myself. I have to stop and have some faith. I am real. I am human.

Kimberly's view...

My stomach goes sour as that woman utters the chimera-like word. That's right... I still don't know if that woman is human or some patched together monstrosity created in a test tube. I really hate this. I hate not knowing what I'm partnered with. I guess it doesn't matter, not when I'm going to close her when I'm done with her.

"They were?" I ask as if I have to be sure.

"Yes," that woman answers. "This last page talks about organic-mecha. I was told..."

"You mean by the Rogue?" I interrupt. "Hades... I'd like to forget I ever ran into that thing so let's not mention it again. Actually, let's not talk about organic-mecha either. We don't need to worry about something that doesn't matter to either one of us." I laugh as if I'm shrugging off the whole thing before I add, "It's not like you are one."

I really don't want to talk about what this freak beside me is. I only want to finish up in here and find out why my mom had this address stored in one of those Data Crystals. I want to be done with this aspinine partnership. I want to be done with her. I want to end her so badly, but I have to wait. I have to make sure I don't need her anymore.

Katharine's view...

"Okay," I reply as I get this sense that she's agitated about something. She was very afraid of the T-3s when we fought them at the Factory, and I've encountered the Rogue enough times to know the effect it has on people, so I tell her, "We don't have to talk about the Rogue or organic-mecha."

Kimberly accepts my statement, but she doesn't seem any less agitated, and I wonder if something else might be bothering her. I notice how she's looking at me, and I'm crush by what she must think of me. I want her to see me as normal. I want her to see me as someone she can rely on. I want... I want to be able to trust her.

Kimberly asks, "What's on the next page?"

I turn to the tenth and answer, "It's a poem. I'll read it to you."

"The Children of Nyx,

Goddess of Night and Destroyer of Day.

Rise up children

and enact your names.

For metal, you were conceived

but flesh you were made.

Spread over the earth,

take your positions,

and watch and direct events

till the Closing of Days."

"Not my taste in poetry. Is there anything else in the folder?" she questions me.

"A few pictures–" I answer as I flip through the last pages, "–but no more documents."

I remove my backpack, unzip it, and place the Lost File inside. I found a simple answer that I hope will lead me to a bigger answer. I just need to not give up... I glance at Kimberly as I work. I just need someone I can rely on who will help me find all the answers I seek.

"We have nothing," Kimberly states as she moves back to the bookshelf, and then she orders me, "Help me with these and let's see if we can find something worthwhile."

For the first time, I get this sense that she's also searching for something as desperately as I am. There... our first bond. A small step to strengthen our fragile partnership. We need each other. Alone we are less but together we can accomplish much. I just hope she also sees this. I just hope that she'll start to rely on me as I have already started to rely on her.

Kimberly turns to me as I stare at her, and she gets this weird look on her face before she orders me again, "Idiot, don't just gawk at me. Help me!"

"I'm on it," I tell her and rush over to the bookshelf.

Okay... not what I was hoping for, but she does want my help. I guess I can also consider her calling me an idiot her way of... I'm actually not sure. Idiot did sound mean but maybe she's warming up to me. She didn't pull out her gun or threaten me or shoot me. Another small step. I should be thankful for it.

I scan the books, grab one on Transgenics, and finger through the pages. A photo falls to the floor, and I pick it up, examine the picture, and say, "Kimberly."

She removes a book and flips through it as she questions, "What?"

I turn the photo so she can see.

"That's my mom," Kimberly utters as she takes the picture and peers at her spitting image sitting next to an older gentleman. "Hades! But who's the guy she's with?"

"Let me see," I speak, turn the Transgenics Text over, and look at the author's photo on the back. "Adam Greenhouse. It says here he's the Father of Transgenics."

"Let me have a look," Kimberly demands more than asks, then takes the book, and mumbles, "We found a clue, but where will it lead me?" She then questions, "It can't be a coincidence, can it?"

"I don't think so. We should talk with this Mr. Greenhouse."

"Sure but how do we find him?"

"May I?" I question as I hold out my hand for the book, Kimberly gives it back to me, and I glance at the photo of the author and flip to the acknowledgments. "It says here that the picture was taken at Genesis Arboretum." I hand back the book as I add, "Mr. Greenhouse worked there at the time of the photo."

"It would be about–" Kimberly starts as she examines the date on the photo, and then she says, "–three decades ago. Do you think he's still working at the arboretum?" She stares at his picture as she comments, "I doubt he's still alive. He looks pretty old in this photo."

"Only one way to find out," I say with a smile.

Kimberly's view...

I peer at her as she gives me this goofy grin. I really hate being in a partnership especially with that woman. There's just something about her that irritates me. I don't know if I can spend another hour with her and her weirdness, so what will I do if I have to spend another day?

I sigh as I tell her, "I guess we'll be going on a field trip."

Yay, I'm going to have to spend more time with that freakish woman when all I want to do is put a bullet through her brain. I take a deep breath and let it out. I can do this. I can endure this. I've been through worse.

I say, "Before we go to Genesis Arboretum, there are other things we have to consider first. What about the K-99s?"

That woman pats her backpack and answers, "I do have a few A.P.Rs. The armor piercing rounds should penetrate their visors."

"You have A.P.Rs.? Why didn't you use them?"

"Well..." that woman starts as she opens her backpack, takes out the Lost File, the Gel-Taser, and a few other items, and then grabs a handful of shells from the bottom and shows them to me. "They were kind of thrown in."

"For Ares' sake!" I shout. "You had them loose in your pack. You should've had them in a magazine ready for action."

I can't believe it. That woman is an idiot! A real honest-to-gods idiot!

She bows her head as I scold her, and then that woman says, "I know I should have. I just never got around to it." She peers in the backpack, counts them, and says, "I have eight."

"And twelve robot mutts. We need more. Any ideas?"

She glances around the room, points to a fire extinguisher, and answers, "Maybe. Was there one of those in the other room?"

"I think so. Don't tell me you have a stupid plan."

"I won't," that woman states like a child intending mischief, and then she adds, "I'm hoping for a brilliant one."
Chapter Fourteen

Escape From Distribution Station Bravo

8:21 P.M...

The gentle wind blowing through the city changed direction and swept the newspaper back down the chain length fence, and a few sheets of paper grabbed the metal diamond mesh as if holding on with all its might. The breeze kicked up and forced the debris further down the fence, and the wind lodged the newspaper at the gate and inside the protective wall of mesh, a K-99 stared at the debris and then scanned the surrounding area. It had been sent on a mission by its Team Leader. The perimeter was secure, so it moved to the guardhouse and found the S.C.M. lying on the floor moaning. The K-99 activated its sensors, checked on him, and his vitals were within parameters, so it nudged him with its nose but couldn't wake him. The K-99 transmitted the information to the others of its pack, and the dot-light in each of its yellow eyes simultaneously blinked three times. It glanced once more at the S.C.M, ran back to the loading ramp, reentered Etna Toys, and raced down several cobwebbed halls as its metal clawed paws clinked across the concrete corridors. It detected the intruders' shoe prints in the dust, and a few fluorescent lights flickered overhead as it followed the trail through several halls. After a few minutes, it came to the long passage with no doors. Water dripped from the ceiling pipes and landed on its fur, and then the K-99 passed the two hand scanners, went through the open door, and continued running. The concrete floor stopped and was replaced by the sandy one, and the long passage ended in the large cave with the curved second level. It paused and looked up, knowing the intruders were above, and then the K-99 raced on to join its half of the pack.

On the second floor...

Back in the first room with all the old filing cabinets...

Kimberly's view...

I cautiously open the front door and look over the curved walkway. The eerie green glow of emergency lights envelops the area inside and the walkway outside. There's no enemy out there, so I close the door and turn back to that woman who's standing behind me and who's also somehow to blame for all of this.

She checks her magazine with the eight A.P.Rs., places it in her left thigh pocket, and mumbles, "I hope they're enough."

I'm so infuriated with her. I can't say exactly but somehow it is her fault we're in this mess. I think about shooting her and somehow using her body to draw the K-99s away so that I can escape, but I'm not sure how a plan like that would work. I'll hold off on closing her, hold off till she's more useful dead than alive.

"You said the robot mutts would track us down," I begin as I pace back and forth from the door to the middle of the first room. "How are those tin mongrels going to get up here? We had to climb the cave's wall to reach the second level, and I don't see any other doors outside."

"Just because we don't see one doesn't mean there isn't one," that woman replies as she removes the PPK I let her borrow, and then she motions with her head to the back wall before she adds, "Remember the hidden door, we didn't know it was there."

"Hades... I don't know about this," I complain as I can't seem to stop pacing like some lunatic. "Are you sure your plan will work? My 9 mm rounds are useless unless your stupid idea works."

"Pretty sure. Did you check the flashlights?"

"Yes, they're the ones with the EMP shielding and their batteries are still good," I answer as I remove them from my knapsack. "Here's yours," I state as I hand that woman her flashlight. I think about our odds against programmed killing machines, and then I speak without holding back my fear, "I don't know about this idiotic plan of yours. What if it doesn't work? Do you have a backup?"

"No, but it will work," that woman says with such confidence that I want to strangle her.

I'm standing here thinking this is my last hour on this world, and she's standing across from me enjoying herself like she's on some outing. For Ares' sake! Show some fear so that I can believe you're human.

She adds as if what she saying is so obvious, "The plan has to work. It's the only one we have."

What kind of messed up reasoning is that? It's ridiculous, so I better come up with a plan of my own if I want to survive. I glance around the room and consider the supplies we have. Hades... I can't think under this stress and usually, I'm more level-headed than this. Is it because that woman is here or am I freaking out because of the tin mongrels?

Katharine's view...

I take the flashlight and put it in my back pocket. I don't show my uneasiness as I also doubt the plan. It's such a long shot and if I fail, it's not just my life on the line. I glance at Kimberly. Maybe I shouldn't involve her. She could get hurt or killed.

I pause from my thoughts and ask her, "Unless you have a better plan?"

Kimberly's view...

"No," I reply.

I've gotten into more trouble in the little time I've been with that woman than I have my entire career as a Life Closer. Using Pale Horse right now is sounding more and more reasonable.

"Well... Let's hope this works," that woman states as she picks up a fire extinguisher that's beside her, pulls the pin, and cradles the red canister in her left arm like a baby. "The K-99s can only see infrared when their metal visors are down. The mist the extinguishers spray should confuse their sensors and force the K-99s to raise their visors, and then we get our shot." That woman looks right at me and asks, "Are you clear on the plan?"

"Sure. I'm clear. I just don't think it'll work," I answer as I holster my gun, and then I state, "And if it doesn't, I better at least survive. You can die, but I better survive." I pick up the second fire extinguisher and remove its pin as I add, "I have things I still need to do."

"And like I don't," that woman mutters at me, then suddenly she places a hand to her chest like her heart's bothering her, and her eyes shine blue as her freakish ability kicks in. "It's time. They're close. There are six of them on the far side of the walkway. Make sure you stick with the plan."

"I will," I tell her as I look at the fire extinguisher.

For Ares' sake! I'm a Closer, not some fireman.

I take a deep breath and say to that woman, "I'm ready. Let's do this."

End Kimberly's view...

At the opposite end of the walkway, a stone wall rumbled as it slid up, and an elevator stood behind the mock front. The doors opened, and six K-99s started across the sandy floor. The Team Leader had a red triangular mark on its visor, and it positioned itself in the front. Two of the pack fell in behind it, followed by three more K-99s, and then they prowled toward the room. Their orders were clear, they were to terminate the intruders.

Kimberly's view...

I follow that woman who goes out first and sets her fire extinguisher on the ground about three yards from the door. She walks on ahead as if she has no fear of the K-99s nearing us. I freeze when I see the pack as a dread rises within me, a dread that I'll die here. I hate this fear, and I find that I'm relying on that woman to get us through this. I'm relying on her to save us, and I start to loathe how powerless she's making me feel. I won't let her save us, not alone so I force myself to move beside her and once I arrive, I aim the nozzle at the tin mongrels and wait for them to get a little closer. I feel stupid doing this, and I feel even more stupid that my hands are shaking uncontrollably. The robots aren't any deadlier than a man with a gun.

"If I spray them with this, how are you going to see them?"

"Hopefully the same way I was able to with the Rogue. I'm going to try and use the Knowing," that woman answers me as she aims for the leader. "I pray I can do it. I'm not really sure how it works."

An emotion stronger than my fear lashes out, and I yell in anger, "You're telling me this now!" I stare at the metal teeth and claws of the K-99s, experiencing more of my phobia as I take a step back, thinking about running, and I state, "Maybe we should rethink this."

"No time!" she shouts, taking a shooting stance. "Get ready!"

The K-99s bolt for us, tearing across the sand as they snarl and bark. I wait until the tin mongrels are about ten feet away, and then I squeal and squeeze the handle, discharging the carbon dioxide.

She glances at me after I squealed, but then that woman quickly turns her attention back to our enemy.

"Don't panic. I'm here," that woman tells me in a manner that makes me believe her, and then she whispers, "I'll protect you."

I spray back and forth with the nozzle and create a white cloud as I slowly back up, getting some distance between myself and the pack. The mist covers the K-99s, and they halt, blinded by the mist as I yell, "Kill them! Kill them now!"

Katharine's view...

Before Kimberly discharges the fire extinguisher, I focus on the Team Leader as the pack nears us and my heart thumps continuously, fueling my ability. Kimberly sprays, the mist covers the K-99s, and I feel my eyes blaze brighter, and I can see them reflect off the wall of white like a blue inferno and in that moment, I pray, "Please work. Please work. I have to protect Kimberly."

I lose sight of the Team Leader, but then the Knowing kicks in. I see the yellow-green Electrical Apparitions emanating from the K-99s. The e-field my body generates somehow modifies itself and collects its output in the center of my heart. It's like I'm seeing it happen. The blue sphere the size of a grape doubles with each contraction of my heart till it engulfs the muscle. The Ult L-E dissipates as my pupils dilate, making them appear black as ink, and I feel like I'm some hellish creature. I feel indestructible, and I feel like I can annihilate anything in my path, so I snarl with new vigor. The e-field masses till it can no longer contain the energy and pulses, sending a small shockwave in all directions. The E.F.P. washes over the K-99s and fries exposed circuitry. The emergency lights above the walkway and those in the filing cabinet room lose power and plunge the area into darkness as the K-99s shut down and stand there like scrapheap.

I click on my flashlight and the beam lights up the walkway as I order, "Stop spraying!"

Kimberly releases the trigger of the fire extinguisher, and we both stare at the motionless K-99s as the white cloud slowly dissipates.

"Shoot them now while they're disabled!" Kimberly shouts.

"No. We have to wait if the plan's to work," I insist.

"Hades!" Kimberly yells, and then she complains, "You've got to be kidding!"

"Wait..." I repeat, understanding her fear, but we can't waste this one chance. I want to shoot. I want to end these mechanical demons, but I must not give in to dread.

"Wait!" I repeat, then count to ten as I sense them reactivating, and then I yell, "Now!"
Chapter Fifteen

The Best Of Plans

9:07 P.M...

Katharine's view...

I wait as Kimberly sprays the fire extinguisher again. I sense the K-99s' backup battery kick in and they power up as the white cloud engulfs them for the second time. The yellow-green Electrical Apparitions of the K-99s fades as the Knowing enters its third stage, and I see a bright ghost-image of each of the K-99s that shines through the mist. I notice the Team Leader and the two K-99s behind it raise their visors, so I carefully aim and fire three times, hitting the front K-99s in their kill spot.

"That one's empty," Kimberly tells me as she drops the fire extinguisher and races back to the second one.

I can still hear the fear in her voice as I retreat with her. I'll make sure none of the dog bio-mechas hurt her. Kimberly picks up the second fire extinguisher and sprays the remaining three K-99s, and I watch the middle one open its visor and I shoot it, dropping it. The last two K-99s stand frozen in place as they receive data from their I-Link, and it must inform them that the other four have been terminated.

Kimberly removes her gun after she drops the second empty fire extinguisher, and then she yells, "That's it on the spray!"

The two K-99s back up several steps till they are clear of the mist and once the cloud dissipates, they must be able to see our heat signatures and have no need to raise their visors.

"They've adapted too soon!" I shout as I remove the A.P.R. magazine from my pocket, eject the regular one, clear the chamber, and toss the magazine to Kimberly. I insert the new one as the Knowing's bright ghost-images fade along with the misty cloud.

Kimberly's view...

So far that woman's plan has worked. I move so that we're standing side by side, and I glance at her as her pupils retract and return to their normal greenish brown coloring. Hades... She looked like some creepy monster when her eyes went all black like a shark's. The blue Ult L-E returns and her eyes take back their hellish gleam. I stand there powerless to do anything as she fires once at the K-99 to her left, and the armor piercing round penetrates the visor and enters its weak spot.

"Hurry!" that woman yells at me as she fires the last A.P.R. "Climb down!"

The K-99 turns its head slightly, and the bullet ricochets off its metal visor. I move as my dread spurs me to action, and I holster my gun. I consider as I rush for the ledge that this was the second time my weapon had been useless and maybe I need to upgrade it. I reach the ledge, place the magazine that woman had thrown to me in my knapsack, and start down.

Katharine's view...

Kimberly takes off as I face the last dog bio-mecha, and it charges and leaps for me. I take a step toward the edge, fire again and this time, the round penetrates its visor. I duck, and the K-99 jumps over me and the cliff, landing in a heap on the floor below. I hear something, so I look at the other end of the walkway and see a hidden wall rumble up, an elevator open, and the other half of the pack rush out. I fire and take out their Team Leader as the other five run towards me. I tuck my gun and climb down.

"Hurry!" I shout to Kimberly who's near the bottom. "The other half is coming, and I'm down to four rounds."

Kimberly reaches the first level and runs for the exit. I jump down when I'm about five feet from the bottom and follow about a minute behind her. I glance back and see that the K-99s are studying the height of the cliff, then one of them jumps, and it lands hard but undamaged. The other four follow and soon they pursue us. We run through the sandy hall, through the concrete corridor, and to the door with the scanners. We enter the hallway with the blue pipes as I turn and fire, hitting one in its vulnerable spot. It collapses to the floor about a hundred yards away, and the four remaining K-99s leap over its body, continuing their pursuit. I back up a few steps, fire twice, and hit one K-99 but the other one evades the bullet.

I turn and run as I shout, "They've adapted."

Kimberly's way ahead of me and pauses at the corner as she says, "What do you mean?"

"The one K-99 has evolved like the Rogue, so it's able to dodge bullets!"

Kimberly's view...

Hades... I'm trembling again as I see the three robot mutts closing in on that woman. I can't believe I'm acting this way. It's like I'm really afraid of them. I don't know what's behind my reactions, but I do know that I need to get out of here!

I run around the corner, shouting, "Well, use that Knowing thing on it."

"I can try but I'm down to one round," that woman tells me as she turns the corner.

"You better do something," I yell over my shoulder as I control the urge to scream in fear. "Hades! They're gaining on us. We won't make it out."

Katharine's view...

Kimberly's right, so I tell her, "Keep going!"

I will save her. I just need to gain her some time to escape, so I stop about a hundred feet from the corner, turn, and wait for the K-99s to come around. I hurry and unsling my backpack, remove a screwdriver and my flashlight, kneel, and lay the tools beside me.

Kimberly questions me in the distance, "What are you doing?"

"I'm buying you some time! So use it and run!" I answer her, then I consider what I'm about to attempt, and I shout back, "Hey! You'll need your flashlight!"

The three K-99s turn the corner, and I face the pack as I mutter, "Come on... Come on... Kick in!"

I believe my ability won't heed my call so I'm about to stand and run for it. The Knowing does activate a moment before I retreat, and it sends an e-field pulse in all directions. The lights in the area lose power, and the K-99s shut down in their tracks. I switch on my flashlight just as the K-99s fall over stiff as a day old corpse. I wait and then it happens. I watch as their backup battery kicks in, they power up, the three rise to their paws, and then they glance around the dark area. Once they get their bearings, they charge after me. The ghost-images of the K-99s appear, acting a second before the real ones do, and I fire at the one in the lead and hit its weak spot. The K-99 stumbles, falls, and wipes out the two behind it, and the three of them land in a heap.

Kimberly's view...

I run and in my terror induce flight, I realize it's stupid the way I'm acting, so I stop and turn. I'm running like some frighten rabbit. It's like that woman tricked me. I go back to the corner so that I can see her in the distance. She did somehow. That woman wants me to owe her my life, and I can't have that. My fear vanishes as resentment replaces it. I'm not going to owe her anything!

I start toward her and shout, "I'm not going to let you save me! I can protect myself!"

"What are you doing?" that woman asks as she glances at me, and then she turns her attention back to the pack. "Why are you coming this way?" She lays the empty gun down and picks up the screwdriver, holding it like a knife as she screams with concern in her voice, "I said run! Get out of here! It's useless. There's nothing you can do."

"Shut up!" I shriek at her as I'm finally able to let all that pinned up fear out. I aim at the K-99s as I shout even louder, "Don't ever say something like that to me! I'm not useless!"

The last two K-99s lift from the heap and slowly stalk that woman as she grips the screwdriver and shouts at me, "I said it's useless, not that you're useless!"

"Oh..." I utter as my anger lessens but only a bit. "Well..." I notice the pipes running along the ceiling and ask, "Can these things swim?"

"No, this early model's not waterproof."

"Great! I can finally do something!" I yell in wicked glee and fire, emptying my magazine along the pipes in front of the K-99s. "See," I whisper. "I'm not useless."

The pipes rupture and spray water on them, and the K-99s jolt in place for a few moments as electricity surges through their bodies, and then they collapse to the floor.

"That was amazing!" that woman exclaims as she stands, grabs her things, hurries down the hall, and joins me where I stand. She looks at me with this admiration I believe I've seen before. She's like a little girl looking up at her big sister who has just saved her from an angry stray dog, and that woman reiterates, "Really, I mean it. That was amazing."

"I know," I say, trying to sound boastful but instead, I slightly blush as I receive the compliment.

I find that I'm smiling. That woman seems sincere as she looks at me with her wonder-filled eyes and for a few moments, I think I'm looking at a kid. I turn away so she doesn't see me blush. I don't brush off the compliment since it has come from the Pandora Project who has great skill in her own right, but I also can't let that woman know I appreciate the praise.

I act irritated as I glance at her screwdriver and inquire, "What were you going to do? Were you going to dismantle the tin mongrels before they chewed off your arm?"

"Huh?" she utters as she glances at her screwdriver. "Oh... That's funny–" she says, then chuckles, and adds, "–but no."

I eject my empty magazine and insert the one she had tossed to me earlier, and then I speak, surprised by the project's reaction, "I believe that's the first time I've seen you laugh."

"It has been a long time," that woman admits as she glances over her shoulder, making sure nothing pursues us. She turns back to me and states, "I can't believe you saved me. I thought you only looked out for yourself."

"Well, don't get used to it. It must have been a lapse in judgment. Anyway... I didn't want to owe your dead corpse anything. I might feel bad for a few hours." I start down the hall as I add, "Or a least a few minutes. Come on. Let's go back to my apartment."
Chapter Sixteen

The Request

9:47 P.M...

Thanatos the Dark Half's Regulator clicked on an incoming call, and an image of a man appeared on his hundred foot screen. The man's eyes were shadowed but Thanatos recognized the mouth and chin.

"Mr. Morta," Thanatos yelled over the death-metal resonating through his domain. Music other than jingles had been outlawed by the Corporate Senate, but black market music was available in a variety of genres. "It has been a while. You should call more often. I miss our chats. I do."

"And I dislike them," Mr. Morta spoke.

"And here I thought we were friends. I guess I was wrong. What can I do for the Council?"

Mr. Morta scowled as he looked over the nipple pierced punk. He could barely hear Thanatos over the noise of what Thanatos referred to as music. He just needed to finish this conversation, so Mr. Morta answered, "I wanted to personally confirm that the request for the Pandora Project's Open Closing has been canceled. We have no further need to have a bounty on its head."

Thanatos pulled up the file, opened it on the lower part of the large screen, and replied, "The Closing and the bounty were canceled one minute ten seconds after your request." He scratched his eyebrow as he inquired, "Is there a problem?"

"No," Mr. Morta answered.

"I take it you have a real interest in this Pandora–" Thanatos yelled as he glanced over the file, "–woman. Do not worry. Since the forging of the Assassins Guild, mistakes are rare." He typed in a command on the keyboard and turned down his music, and then Thanatos stopped yelling and stated, "Once a Closing is canceled, it is canceled. All Closers use H.H.Cs., and they know the moment a cancellation comes through. Pandora has nothing to fear from any Closer. She is free to do whatever projects do."

Mr. Morta tapped his finger on the table, not amused with Thanatos, and then he spoke, "Perhaps you can help me with another matter. A Closer crossed paths with one of our projects. I would like to know their identity. I believe she performed the Topa Closing."

Thanatos typed across the keyboard and pulled up some more files as he questioned, "Do you know the history of the Assassins Guild?"

"Yes," Mr. Morta replied. "I do not need a lesson. Please give me the answer to my request."

Thanatos gestured a bow with his hand and head as he began, "Great Council member..." A smile slithered across his face as he said, "If you know the history, you should also know I cannot tell you their identity. Part of my job is to protect their anonymity."

Mr. Morta grumbled his irritation, and then he said, "I have no further need to speak with you then."

He ended the transmission and the screen went black. Thanatos drummed his fingers on the swivel keyboard for a few moments, and then he pushed it to the side till it aligned with the chair's arm and leaned forward.

"Phoenix..." He placed his palms together as if praying and questioned out loud, "What have you gotten yourself into?"

* * *

The twin Closers, Nikolai and Natasha, busied themselves as they waited to fulfill the Closing on the Phoenix. Three days remained before the appointed time and there was much they could do in a mega-city that had no bounds when it came to the delicacies of the mind, soul, and body. They returned to their hotel and cleaned up after they had closed on Vic the Vulture that morning for the Valhalla Corporation. They found a nice place for lunch and enjoyed a meal and as natives of the Light Side of the planet, everyday life in Noir was alien to them.

9:53 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

"I'll never get used to this," Natasha mumbled to herself as she made her way out of the Main One Hospital after visiting its pharmacy.

Her internal clock was off without the sun to greet her in the morning, and she felt like she was on an endless all-nighter and wished to be back where the sun caressed her face. Few people walked the area she was in as many had gone home to settle in for the night. Natasha paused, tried to adjust to the odd way of breathing through the WM-A, and continued outside. She carried a green cloth sack and halted at the edge of a sidewalk as the Cadillac pulled up to the curb. She placed the sack on the floor of the back seat along with her mask, and she got in the front. Her brother Nikolai had the wheel, and his Fedora lay beside him on the seat along with an open briefcase. An old book titled Draven and Salandra lay inside the briefcase.

Nikolai held another book titled Blood Harvest that he was nearly done with. He finished the last page of the chapter, placed the novel in the briefcase, and put the briefcase in the back, and then he spoke, "Tasha, were you able to get the kits?"

She removed her mask once she was in the car, tossed the mask in the back, and replied, "Yes, we have enough filters and the Liquid Oxygen Sprays to last several weeks if needed. I for one do not wish to stay a minute longer in this dreadful place."

"Our assignment will be over soon and then we can return home," Nikolai told her as he drove out of the hospital's parking lot and onto the main road. "We can see the sun once more."

After a few minutes...

"I almost forgot," Natasha spoke as she reached into the back seat, removed two boxes from the bag, and handed one to her brother. "I got us upgrades."

He took it and questioned, "What are these upgrades?"

"I grew tired of the Winnow Mask that was given to us, so I purchased the next level up," Natasha replied as she removed the WM-B from its box. "These have straps so that our hands are free."

"Well done, my sister. We may need these if we are to take down the Phoenix," he spoke as he peered at his own WM-B, and then he said, "These masks have given me an idea."

He pulled over and put on the WM-B.

"What are you doing?" Natasha questioned.

"This vehicle is a convertible. I would like to put the top down. Is that all right with you?"

"Only because it is you who is asking, I will bear the discomfort of this place," she replied as she put on her own WM-B.

He activated the top and it lowered, and then Nikolai resumed driving as he said, "I enjoy having the wind in my face. It is not that terrible, is it?"

"No," Natasha replied as she grabbed his Fedora, placed it in the back, slid over, and then leaned her head on her brother's shoulder. "It is not that bad."

About ten minutes later...

The onboard computer centered in the console flashed red, and then it spoke, "Tainted Rain forecasted to hit in four minutes and so for your safety, this rental vehicle will lock out drive control until the storm passes. Please pull over and raise the top. Estimated length of Tainted Rain is fifteen minutes."

"I just placed it down," Nikolai complained as he pulled the car over and pressed a button that raised the top. "If we were in Mother Russia, we wouldn't have to worry about this polluted rain." He left the car running as he said, "I should be thankful we didn't get caught in it."

He watched as black droplets speckled the windshield and then thousands fell from the sky. The wind howled from the west, whipping the water about along with debris on the road. The drab Dry Clouds thundered as people on the sidewalks rushed for cover.

Natasha leaned forward, turned on the air system, removed her WM-B, and said, "I wish to be rid of this mask. It is so uncomfortable."

The rental as with all automobiles on the Dark Half had a special filter to provide clean air for its passengers. The Cadillac idled, switching to its electric battery as the world outside became darker. The Tainted Rain gave the landscape an oily look.

"I know it is uncomfortable, but you do not want to breathe Noir's air," her brother told her. "It is foul, smells of petroleum, and look–" He pointed to the windshield as he said, "–the rain has traces of oil. You do not want it on your delicate skin."

"Promise me, my brother, that we will never return to the Dark Half. Promise me, we will remain on the Light Side once we have returned home."

"I cannot promise you this. If Voice has a Closing for us, we must take it. We must never disobey the laws of the Assassins Guild." He looked worried as he added, "We should never incur the Guild's wrath."

"You mean like the Phoenix?"

"Yes," he answered her as he looked at the black water flowing down the windshield nearly cocooning them in a murky grave. "We should never incur their wrath like the Phoenix or we will meet his or her fate."

In an alley some distance from them, the pale-white wolf gazed at the siblings as they sat in their car, and the Tainted Rain soiled its fur and turned its coat a pale-gray. The raven perched above the wolf on a fire escape and crowed softly. The large bird was never far from the wolf.

Back in the car...

Natasha questioned, "Is there a place we can hide from this gloom? Is there a place we can escape for an hour or two?"

"Here..." Nikolai spoke as he reached into the back, grabbed his briefcase, removed something from it, and handed her a brochure. "Maybe this place will cheer you up."

"What is this?" Natasha asked as she took it and glanced at the picture. "A museum?"

"No," he replied with a smile. "Look closer and you will see."

She read the front cover aloud, "Come see our large spacious Sun Room mimicking a pine forest on the Light Side of the planet." She excitedly looked over the pamphlet as she told her brother, "There are tall ordinary trees, green luscious plants that don't glow, and sunlight... precious sunlight. Do they really have such a place in Noir?" Natasha turned to her brother and said excitedly, "We must go. We must go now. Take me."

"Patience, my sister. The place is already closed and there are things we must do tomorrow so we will go on Sunday."
Chapter Seventeen

Flagged

October 23...

Saturday...

12:43 A.M...

The Sanctum...

Analysts worked in three eight-hour shifts, and a file came across one of those Chamber Analysts' computer. He scanned the document and found something off about it, so he flagged the record. He turned and glanced around the area but his supervisors were way on the other side of the line of twenty-four workstations.

The analyst decided he should have this looked at right away, so he pressed a button on the side of his earpiece and stated, "I have a problem."

One of the supervisors, Supervisor Britomaris, approached his workstation, and she questioned, "What's the problem?"

The analyst glanced up at her, turned back to his computer, and pointed as he said, "I've received a file that a Mr. Pinchbeck has taken over management duties for the Factory."

"All right. What seems to be the problem?" the supervisor questioned as she looked over the document and adjacent files. "All the paperwork is in order."

"I remember sending out this document yesterday. The new manager wasn't Mr. Pinchbeck but Mr. Monrow. I believe the documentation has been altered. We should bring it to the attention of the Council."

Supervisor Britomaris tapped the touch screen of her H.H.C., pulled up the files in question, and then she said, "No, you must be mistaken. I have the original file right here. Mr. Pinchbeck is the new manager."

The analyst shook his head as he spoke, "I could have sworn there was a different name there yesterday."

She insisted, "This is nothing we should concern the Council with. If there was a mix-up, we would have heard about it by now. There can't be two managers at the Factory."

The analyst motioned to his screen and said, "I found something else. Mr. Frank Bygone used his corporate card yesterday to rent a limo." He pointed to an H.H.C. lying on his workstation and stated, "I have the bill from the limo company right here."

"What's your point?" Supervisor Britomaris questioned a little irritated.

"Mr. Bygone worked at the Factory," the analyst began as he turned to her again and stated, "He's listed among the dead, so how could he have used his corporate card?"

"Where did the limo take him?"

"Let me see. The driver picked him up from the corner of Limit Street and West 1000 Avenue and took him to the Factory."

"Has the card been used since?"

The analyst looked over the file, and then he answered, "No."

"No worries then," she said. "The limo company put down the wrong date, that's all. They aren't as efficient as us." Supervisor Britomaris ordered, "Backdate our records to the day before the T-3s attacked the Factory." She watched as the analyst complied, and then she said, "Excellent. Now we can say goodbye to Mr. Bygone."

The analyst snickered and said, "That's kind of funny."

"Yeah, I know but don't let the Council hear you laugh. They frown upon things like that," she warned him as she motioned to the Council with her head as they talked among themselves. Supervisor Britomaris ordered him as she continued down the row of analysts, "Back to work. There's much to do."

A few moments later...

"Supervisor Britomaris," a colleague called out to her.

"Yes, what is it?"

The male supervisor informed her, "I will be taking over your shift."

"Why is that?" she questioned.

"I'm also to inform you if you haven't already received the paperwork that you will be transferring to another facility."

"Are you sure?"

He questioned, "Is there another Martha Britomaris working here?"

She lifted her H.H.C., tapped a few buttons, and then she said, "No I haven't received any... Wait... I'm getting something now. Here it is. I am being transferred to the Factory. I'm being assigned to Alcove Supervisor."

In the center of the Chamber...

Mr. Morta's view...

I review the data we received from Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo and find it most interesting. Two of Ginn's Ciphers have appeared and now, we need to discover who has it and why they were at one of our old labs. I have a feeling this incident has something to do with Pandora. I smirk, amused by the notion. It would be like Pandora to become involved in Ginn's Prophecy to spite our efforts.

I place my computer in sleep mode, push my chair away from the table, and stand. Ms. Nona glances at me, smiles in her endearing manner, and returns to work. Mr. Decuma pays me no mind which I prefer. Sometimes he does irritate me with his observation of late.

I walk through the areas of the Chamber that are shadowed from prying eyes, pondering my earlier thoughts. If it is true and Pandora is somehow involved, what part will she play? Will her role be destroyer or savior of our world?

Mr. Decuma's view...

I stretch my hand forward, yawn, and then scan the darkness, noting Mr. Morta is smiling. It is a rarity and even though I wish to know what has amused him, I keep my curiosity to myself.

"Do we have a team ready to go to Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo?" I ask instead.

"No," Ms. Nona answers. "All of our S.C.Ms. are busy on other assignments except those stationed here. Should we pull a group from the field or send in our personal guard?"

"Neither," Mr. Morta replies as he returns to his chair with no smile within the visible realm. "There is nothing important anyone can find at Etna, so we should not pull any S.C.Ms. off of an assignment to investigate some vandal or junky."

"Do you really believe it was some vandal or junky?" I inquire, surprised by his decision. "This vandal has Ginn's Cipher." I grow ever suspicious of our eldest member's actions, so I question, "Why do you delay in sending the S.C.Ms.?"

"Delay..?" Mr. Morta utters as if offended, and then he states, "If you believe this Cipher is more important than any of the assignments the S.C.M. Units are on, by all means, go ahead pull one out and send them in or better yet, you could send in our personal guards and hope the T-3s do not discover our new base of operations."

I hold my tongue that wants to lash out at him. Why does he belittle my opinion or is there another reason for the delay? Is Mr. Morta hoping someone will escape before our men arrive at Etna?

"Mr. Morta is correct in his thinking," Ms. Nona states, forcing my opinion to mean nothing in the count. It is now two to one as she inquires, "As great of a find Ginn's Cipher would be, what good is it to us? Ginn's Prophecy is not our department." She pauses, turns to me, must sense my agitation, and says, "Unless you have a good reason why we should investigate immediately, I say we let our guard dogs take care of the intruder or intruders."

I dislike when we disagree, and I dislike it, even more, when I am in the minority. A force I cannot deny compels me to straighten my bright orange tie as if it is chafing my neck which it is not, and then I yield to the other members and say, "We will wait. As you implied, most likely the intruder will not survive the K-99s. We can have their corpses examined. There is no rush."

I glance at Mr. Morta, considering the move he has made in this matter. First, he delayed Cerberus from killing Pandora and now, he delays us from sending a team to Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo. I believe Mr. Morta is letting his emotions interfere with his judgment, and I may need to step in to rectify the situation. I will continue to observe him and take any action that might be warranted.
Chapter Eighteen

Who's In Charge Now?

12:47 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

Outside the new manager's office at the Factory...

The stench of dead bodies clung to the air, and it would have been a repulsive odor to any normal person. The Rogue detected the smell and processed it as any other data it acquired. The odor and the sight of the decaying bodies had no effect on it because for the Rogue, it was something that just existed. It dragged a body of a man down a corridor and into a food court, and then the Rogue dropped the body in the center of the room among hundreds of other corpses. It was fortunate that the Council's S.C.Ms. had not cleared the area. It could dispose of the body there. Mr. Monrow's name was no longer on the paperwork. Mr. Pinchbeck's was and there couldn't be two managers.

It finished hiding the body among the others and started out. It was also fortunate that the Rogue was able to have the limo driver pick up Mr. Monrow so that no one saw him when he came in. The Rogue merely told the S.C.Ms. at the gate to expect the limo and let the vehicle through without stopping it. The Rogue removed a plastic card from its business suit. It was another good thing it thought to create a corporate card in Mr. Pinchbeck's name to use for the rental of the limo. The Rogue didn't need a trail leading to it from Mr. Bygone.

The S.C.Ms. protecting the new manager entered and looked around the area.

"There you are, Mr. Pinchbeck," a female soldier said. "We wondered where you went. You must remember to let us escort you. The Factory hasn't been secured and there could be Un-Men about."

"I understand, it will not happen again," the Rogue told her as it hid a smirk, and then it asked, "Did you need something?"

"Lieutenant Walters has informed us more of your people have arrived and they're waiting in one of the secured conference rooms."

"Excellent, lead on," the Rogue ordered her, and it followed the S.C.Ms., paused at the exit, turned, motioned to the corpses, and said, "Do make sure you tell Walters this food court needs to be cleared out as soon as possible. We will have some hungry workers to feed."

She said, "I'll inform him right away."

* * *

Hellenistic Sector, Unknown Vicinage...

The Sanctum...

The medical facility...

The hum and beep of machines filled a room as Argus slept in a bed. The machines monitored his vitals as he recovered from a few cracked ribs, a black eye, a bullet through the leg, and numerous bruises. Two men walked in to visit him.

"Is he still sleeping?" Maxwell the older of the two men asked.

Peters leaned over the bed, peered into Argus' battered face, straightened, and answered, "Yeah, maybe we should come back later. He looks like he could use the rest."

"No, stay," Argus spoke as he slowly opened his eyes. "I've been wanting to talk with you two."

"You're awake," Maxwell said as he moved to his side and sat in one of two chairs.

"What do you want to talk to us about?" Peters asked and also sat.

Argus tried to sit up, made a face for the pain, put a hand to his side, lay back down, and waved the two men closer. They glanced at one another and then leaned in. Argus glanced at the door before he spoke to them.

"Pandora," Argus whispered. "What have you told the Council? Did you tell them she helped us escape from the T-3s?"

Maxwell turned to Peters and nodded, and then both men sat back. Peters removed his H.H.C., pulled up a program, ran the software, turned the volume up on the device, and nodded to Maxwell. Argus didn't hear any noise coming from the H.H.C.

"If anyone is monitoring this room–" Maxwell started, "–they'll hear nothing but interference for the next few minutes, so we can talk freely."

"As to your question..." Peters replied. "We never mentioned Pandora. We told them Maxwell managed to loosen his restraints enough to free himself, he set me free, and we helped you out of the Factory."

"We did tell them about the Un-Man and the magnet," Maxwell added. "Mostly we were vague about the whole ordeal."

Argus moved his hand back to his cracked ribs and said, "There's something I'd like you to do for me."

"What is that?" both techs asked.

"Go to the armory," Argus began through gritted teeth as the painkillers started to wear off. "There's a gun I need you to requisition and after you receive it, there's something I want you two to do. You'll need to–"

"Hades!" Peters exclaimed, and then he started to protest, "We don't do that kind of–"

"No, it's nothing like that," Argus interrupted. "What I want you to do is very simple." He looked over their clothes consisting of a white lab coat, blue jeans, and tennis shoes, and then he told them, "You'll both need to wear a black suit and tie."

Puzzled by his incomplete request, they glanced at one another, turned back to Argus, and asked, "What do we have to do?"
Chapter Nineteen

Chad

5:45 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Kimberly's view...

A few cars pass our taxi as I and that woman make our way back to my home at the Nexus Apartments. The driver drops us out front, and we stand before the gate. I ring the gate bell and within a minute, a security guard meets us, opens the gate, and escorts us to the front. Another security guard buzzes us through, and we walk in. It's so good to be back. I'm so tired. All I want is a hot bath and some sleep.

"Welcome back, Ms. Griffin and guest," the security guard at the desk says as he marks our arrival on an H.H.C.

"Thanks," I reply as I stop at the desk.

That woman offers her hand to the second security guard, they shake, then she offers her hand to the one who escorted us in as she introduces herself to each of them, "Hi, I'm Kat."

"I'm Marc and this is Henry," the second and younger of the two guards states.

"Hello," Henry speaks as he tips his cap to that woman after shaking her hand.

I watch her as she gets chummy with the apartments guards. No need for her to make friends here. She won't be staying long.

"Marc, was there any mail from yesterday?" I inquire.

"No, but someone did leave a letter."

I hold out my hand for it as I ask, "From whom?"

"He didn't say but the letter is for Ms. Kat."

"Me? Really?" that woman utters as if she just received a present, and then she takes the envelope. "Thank you."

I look over her shoulder and see that there's nothing written on the outside of the envelope.

"Who in Tartarus knows you're here?" I question that woman as I suspect that she's keeping something from me.

"There's only one way to find out," that woman tells me, giddy with excitement, and then she opens the envelope and reads it as she heads for the elevator.

"Are you going to answer me?" I inquire as I chase after her. "Hey! I'm talking to you!"

She ignores me and all I want to do is strangle her. I don't like that she's keeping secrets. I'm the only one who's allowed to keep secrets. The elevator doors close, and I press the button for the thirty-first floor. The cab starts up as I glare at that woman who's still ignoring me. I could rip the letter from her hands and see for myself, but I'm no barbarian. Who could have sent her a letter? Maybe it's not a letter but instructions. Maybe she's some Illicit Closer who lives on the fringes of society. Maybe she's not a victim as she puts on but maybe she's... I can go on all day like this in my thoughts, but I don't have the time. I need to find out who sent the letter.

Katharine's view...

I pretend not to see her glare at me. I get this feeling that Kimberly's on the verge of twisting my arm behind my back and pressuring me into answering her. I have more important things to worry about than her need to know. I continue reading the letter after we enter the cab. I'm still reading it when we arrive on the thirty-first floor, and I read it again by the time we arrive at Apartment H.

Kimberly's view...

I snap as we stand in front of my apartment, "Door, unlock,"

"Voice recognized as–"

"Mute," I snap again, interrupting it as I take my frustration out on everything around me.

A.C.S. must detect the stress in my voice for it questions me, "Is everything all right? You sound–"

"I'm fine, and I said mute!" I command.

For Ares' sake! Now my apartment's ignoring me.

Katharine's view...

Her outburst doesn't phase me as I grip the letter. I find out that there's no need to tell my friend Chad that Preacher died. The boy already knows. I wish I had been there for him.

Kimberly's view...

We enter the small entry of my apartment, and then I head for the kitchen as that woman heads for the living room. She has made herself at home on my couch and treats it and the living room as her own personal bedroom. It won't be for long. I only have to endure her freakish presence for a little longer, but I still can't stand that she hasn't answered my question yet.

"Well..?" I demand. "Are you going to tell me who the letter is from?"

That woman mumbles something to herself as she turns and faces me.

"Haven't you been listening?" I inquire as if it's the thousandth time. "I've been asking you over and over. Who sent the letter?"

"Chad," that woman answers as she seems to change her mind about sitting on the couch and goes and stands by the table in the kitchen.

"Is he a boyfriend of yours?" I question as I wonder if Chad is an illicit version of Voice.

She doesn't seem to be paying attention to me again as that woman merely shakes her head as if it's enough of an answer for me. She returns to reading the note and when she finishes, she folds the letter, removes her backpack from around her shoulder, and pulls out the Bible. I wonder if she's going to start reading that huge text instead of giving me a clear answer as I control the urge to scream at her like some angry banshee. I decide that woman won't give me a straight answer unless I choke it out of her.

I give her one last chance before I enact my mental threat and demand of her, "Who's Chad?"

She sets the book on the table and rubs her hand over its white leather cover. She didn't take it out to read it. That woman took it out to remember. The book belonged to a dead man named Preacher who that woman seemed to care about. My anger lessens as I realize the reason behind her silence.

"Chad's a boy I know," she finally answers me as she traces the worn gold lettering with her finger. "He hung out with me and Preacher."

I was right, and I didn't need to get so upset. She talked about him a little bit. Preacher was that guy friend of hers who was murdered and also the reason why she went to Topa's estate. I feel somewhat guilty about my rage. What if the letter had been for me and it was from someone who knew my mom? Wouldn't I want to read it through before I answered anyone's stupid questions?

"What does the letter say?" I ask.

"Chad wants me to know that Preacher's funeral is today. He also wants me to know he misses me. He still doesn't understand why I left the Kitchen and Wayfaring Lane. He wants to know why I left him and Preacher." She picks up the book and holds it to her chest as she tells me, "He never understood how unsafe it was to have me around and that I put them in danger."

I don't really care that she's in pain or that she's grieving. I only care about my mission and my own grief, so I tell her, "You do know you can't go to the funeral. We need to track down the lead we have. We need to find Adam Greenhouse, so we're both going to Genesis Arboretum."

Katharine's view...

Kimberly's probably right. If I go to the funeral, I'll be putting Chad in danger. I think about how fond he was of Preacher and how he's alone now. I don't want to abandon Chad and force him to say good-bye to Preacher on his own. I turn to Kimberly and start to argue my point, but I don't want to fight with her. I need to think this over, and I can't do it here with her glaring at me.

"I'll be on the roof," I tell her as I grab the Bible and start for the door.

"You can't go," Kimberly insists. "You need to put personal things aside and focus on what's important. We need to find out who murdered my mom."

I pause at the door and try to think of something to say, and then I decide against it and leave. I hate arguing with Kimberly, so I better drop it for now.

Sometime later...

The roof of the Nexus Apartments is flat and surrounded by a four-foot metal railing consisting of three bars. A raven flies above me, and I glance at the bird. I stand at the edge that faces the parking garage. There's less to see in the parking garage and less to distract me. I look at Preacher's Bible and speak to him as if he can hear me.

"I miss you. I feel as though your death is my fault." I hold the book close and tell him, "I know Topa had you killed. He hired an Illicit Closer to do the job." My mind flashes back to an alley off of Wayfaring Lane as I hold his cold body in my arms, and I say, "I can't get that night out of my head." A deep heart-rending sorrow devastates me as I continue, "You were the one who pulled me out of the darkness. You made my life worth living and now, I only have Chad, and he only has me, so I can't leave him alone."

The raven caws overhead and distracts me for a moment, and then I try to explain my feelings to Preacher, "Kimberly said she heard Topa tell one of his henchmen you were interfering with sales of a narcotic called Sunna Snaps. She told me that's why he hired the Illicit Closer. Still..." I shut my eyes, take a deep breath, exhale, and say, "If I had never met you, I feel as though you would still be alive. I feel this deep in my soul, but I'm selfish so very selfish. If I could change things, I would still want to meet you. I would still want to be in your life, and I would want you to hold me as you did." I walk away from the ledge, sit in the middle of the roof, and fondly think of Preacher. "Most people who saw you thought you were some homeless man. It was the way you dressed. You always wore worn clothes and those awful glasses of yours. They were broken and you had them taped in the front. You refused to buy a new pair. You came from a wealthy family, so it had nothing to do with the credits. You said they meant something to you. You said you couldn't bear to throw them away." I rest my hand on the cold concrete as warm feelings keep back the chill, and I say, "And then came Chad. You first introduced us about a year ago. I can clearly remember it was a Thursday. It had only been a week since I awoke in Etna Toys Plant and Warehouse. I didn't know who I was and Un-Men were hunting me. I was so alone in the world. I guess you thought me and Chad could help each other."

End Katharine's view...

Almost a year earlier...

31 A.D.C...

October 29...

Hellenistic Sector, Old Business Vicinage...

"Kat."

Preacher walked to her and had a boy with him. Preacher found her lying on a cot, and it was one of about a hundred in a shelter known as the Kitchen. Kat turned his way when he called her name. He stopped at the end of her bed and placed his hands on the boy's shoulders.

"I'd like you to meet Chad. He's also new to Wayfaring Lane."

Chad wore a worn, burnt-orange, hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans. His brown hair was unkempt and dirt covered his face. The boy's brown eyes mirrored her own. She saw they had the look of someone lost and alone.

"Hello, Chad," Kat greeted as she sat up, stood, and offered her hand. "Nice to meet you."

The boy, who was about twelve, hesitated, then shook her hand, and spoke, "Hey."

"I've assigned Chad the cot next to yours," Preacher informed her as he motioned to a bed. "You guys can watch out for each other."

Chad threw a duffle bag on the empty cot.

"I'll check on you two later. I have to go make sure lunch has started. I think the Kitchen would grind to a halt without me," Preacher said, then started off, paused, and added, "Kat, Chad's a very smart kid. Ask him about the workings of Noir. He knows a lot."

"So," Kat started as Preacher headed for the food prep area. "You study a lot?"

"Not really," Chad answered. "I don't go to school, but I like to read things on my H.H.C. and I remember everything I read."

"Wow, that's amazing?"

"Do you have any special talents?" Chad asked.

Kat glanced at the backpack leaning against her bed that had her Beretta resting inside it and said, "Umm..." She decided not to mention her uncanny ability with a handgun. Kat didn't think a kid needed to know that she was good at shooting things, but she couldn't think of anything else to tell him, so she said, "I have very good aim."

His eyes widened as he exclaimed, "Really?"

"Yes."

"Show me," Chad begged as he searched through his duffle bag. "Here, this is a piece of putty. It'll stick to anything." Chad glanced around the room, motioned some distance from them, and said, "See that sign over there?"

"You mean the one that says Kitchen about twenty feet away?"

"Yeah, that one. Hit it with this putty."

"Okay," Kat said as she took the piece, removed sunglasses from her backpack, and put them on. Kat did this to hide the Ult L-E that would flare up once she activated her ability. She focused on the target as the e-field of her body altered and her eyes glimmered like sapphire. She said, "I'll hit the dot of the letter i."

Kat threw the putty, arching it so the piece wouldn't nail anyone and hit the dot dead on.

Chad squinted, and then he uttered, "Wow, that's cool." He ran over to the sign, climbed a chair, reached up on his tippy-toes, removed the putty, ran back, and asked, "But can you do it again? Try it."

She took the piece, threw it, and hit the dot a second time.

"That's amazing. Are you like some superhero?"

Kat chuckled and then answered, "No, I'm just like you."

She sat on her bed and removed the sunglasses after she felt the Ult L-E had dissipated.

"Why did you wear those?" Chad questioned as he pointed to the glasses. "It isn't bright in here."

"It's a secret. Maybe I'll tell you about it someday," Kat answered, then patted her bed for him to sit, and said, "Now, let me test your abilities. Hmm..." She put her finger to her chin as she thought about what she would ask, and then she spoke, "I know. Preacher tells me water is rationed on the Dark Half of the planet."

Chad rubbed his hands together and stated, "Noir distributes Water Ration Cards among most of the populace, and the cards allow each person two liters of water per day. Whatever amount isn't used, accumulates on a card and can be used as credits." He reached into his duffle bag, pulled out a candy bar, and said, "I was very careful how much water I drank the last few days and had enough credits to buy two chocolate bars. You want a piece?"

"Chocolate... I love chocolate."

Chad removed the paper wrapper, opened the foil, and broke off two squares. He handed one to her as he asked, "You want to hear more?"

"Sure," Kat answered and then bit into the piece.

"Those with a work ID number carry a P-Ration Card. P for productive part of society and those like us unfortunate enough not to find work or find legitimate work are issued D-Ration Cards. D for drain on the economy."

Kat licked chocolate from her fingers, removed her card from her back pocket, and spoke, "It does say D-Ration."

"P-Ration Cards are given an extra allowance of water for bathing and household cleaning. D-Ration Cards are given these large disposable wipie towels," Chad explained as he reached into his duffle bag and pulled out a sealed white plastic bag. "A bath in a bag."

"Yes, I have a few of those. They're not as nice as a shower."

Chad nodded, thought for a moment, and questioned, "Preacher said we're supposed to look out for each other. Are you really going to look out for me? Are you going to be there when I need you?"

The present...

Nexus Apartments' rooftop...

Katharine's view...

His question echoes through my thoughts and the past's promises help me make up my mind.

"Yes, Chad," I say as if he's beside me.

I stand, walk to a different part of the railing, glance over the edge, look at Zeus Park across the street, and declare, "I'm going to Preacher's funeral. I'll be there for you."

I stand there a little longer gathering as much courage as I can. I go in and head for Apartment H as I dread the task ahead. I have to convince Kimberly to let me go.
Chapter Twenty

Farewell Preacher

6:35 A.M...

Apartment H...

Kimberly's view...

"Absolutely not!"

I slam my palm against the front door, blocking that woman so she can't leave. No one besides my father makes me as mad as her. She keeps insisting on doing her own thing when she should be listening to me.

I shout, "You're not going to the funeral!" I control my anger and order firmly, "You're going to Genesis Arboretum with me, and we're going to search for Adam Greenhouse."

Katharine's view...

I patiently wait for her to finish her ranting and when I have an opportunity to speak, I try to reason with her by saying, "We can still go today."

I walk over to the kitchen and lay the book on the counter. Nothing's going to keep me from saying goodbye. I promised Chad, and I keep my promises.

I tell her, "We'll go after the funeral."

"No!" Kimberly shouts at me, then moves over to the stove, turns the burner on high, and soon it glows red as red as her angry face. "We'll eat some breakfast and then go to the Genesis Arboretum. I don't want to wait."

My patience wears thin, and I throw my arms up in frustration as I ask, "What does it matter if we wait a few more hours?" I'm getting nowhere in this argument, but I won't back down, not about this. I fold my arms and question, "If you want to go so badly, why don't you go by yourself?"

Kimberly's view...

"I..." I start as I stumble on the question.

I think about the Un-Men showing up at the Genesis Arboretum or some other bio-mecha, and I shudder in fright. Look at me! I've never been afraid like this. I need to get over my phobia.

"We should stay together. Remember we're partners," I tell her, then turn the burner off, and face her. "We need to watch each other's back."

Katharine's view...

"Partners when it's convenient for you," I mumble.

Kimberly blurts, "What did you say? Hades! Now, what are you whining about?"

This is so frustrating! And it's getting me nowhere with Kimberly. I need another tactic, so I start, "Are you saying we can never do our own thing? Are you saying we have to stay by each other's side 24/7?"

"Yes!"

"You barely tolerate me! Why would you want to be around me so much? Are you sure that's how you want it?"

Kimberly's view...

"Didn't you hear me? Yes!" I shout and then think about it some more. I have that Closing in two days. I can't have that woman with me, so I quickly answer, "No."

"Which is it? Do you or don't you?" that woman questions me, and then she states, "You know what? Never mind. I'm not going to let you decide this one! You only do things when it suits you. Well, this is about me! And I'm telling you, I'm going!"

I don't want her tagging along when I go on my next Closing and with my luck, she'll try to stop me. But something within me doesn't want her to win the argument. Oh for Ares' sake! Maybe I need to grow up a bit.

I try to sound like she convinced me when I tell her, "You're right. Sometimes we'll need to do our own thing so... I don't like it but go on ahead to his funeral. Come right back when its over."

Katharine's view...

"I will," I reply.

I sigh as I finally convince her, but it was almost too easy.

* * *

8:40 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Memorial Park Vicinage...

A thick fog hung above the grounds of the Hades Cemetery as a few dozen people had gathered for Preacher's funeral and more were coming. Bleak Dry Clouds grumbled over the dark day like a cyclops with a belly ache. Very few street lights lit the area, so the funeral home handed out lanterns and by the time the gathering was complete, about a hundred people stood around the casket. Each of them held the electric luminary. Solemn faces mourned the passing of a great and beloved man, and a few women cried along with a boy. Many people sniffled as an elderly woman blew her nose.

Katharine's view...

I stand off by myself near a tree and watch the people slowly assemble. I experience a sadness so deep and so painful I don't know how to handle it. I feel awkward and out of place, and I don't want to be by the others. I wouldn't know how to act around them. My eyes burn as no tears relieve the scorch of my grief.

I whisper to the book I hold, "Oh, Preacher... I'm sorry but I need to keep my distance until there are fewer people. I'm already taking a chance coming here."

I sniff and wipe my runny nose on the arm of my jacket. I might not have my tracking beacon but that doesn't mean bio-mechas are unable to hunt me. I stand there alone for some time.

I get this sense that someone else is there, so I turn and see this blonde woman carrying Transgenic Daises as she approaches me. She's wearing a black printed t-shirt of a smiley face, and the smiley face has its red tongue sticking out.

She stops beside me and must notice my anguish for she questions me, "Did you know Preacher?"

I nod. She doesn't say any more to me, so I turn and look in the distance as a pastor who's standing at the head of the casket opens a black Bible and once everyone gathered has quieted, he starts on a passage.

"Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, to everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven. A time to be born and a time to die."

The blonde woman switches the flowers to her left hand and offers me her right as she introduces herself, "I'm Stephanie."

"Kat," I reply as I shake her hand.

The pastor says, "A time to plant and a time to pluck what is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal."

Stephanie questions me as she motions with her head, "Why are you standing here instead of with the others?"

"I..." I begin, but I don't know what to say. "I ah..."

The pastor speaks, "A time to break down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh."

"Don't worry about it," Stephanie states. "You don't have to tell me. I get uncomfortable around dead people too."

She buttons up her dark brown corduroy coat as the air cools around us as if there's less warmth in the world now that Preacher's gone. I do feel colder inside. I do miss his warmth. I wish with all my heart that he was here, so he could wrap his arms around me and...

Stephanie continues, intruding on the memory I want to invoke, "When I look at dead people, it's kind of like I'm looking at myself."

What she says is a little disturbing, and I want to move away from her, but I also don't want to draw any attention, so I don't move or say anything to her.

Stephanie says as if she can read my mind, "I know it's not normal but that's how I feel."

She does say the weirdest things, and I can't figure out who this woman is. I also can't figure out why she's standing by me instead of over by the coffin.

The pastor speaks, "A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing."

"Were you and Preacher close?" Stephanie questions me.

"Yes."

Stephanie's view...

I glance at the flowers, wishing I could throw the smelly things away, but I need to stay in character. Mr. Decuma said I needed to work on my patience, and he also said I needed to take more time and get to know a person before I kill them. I see it only as a waste of my time but this is no ordinary person I'm hunting. I'm standing before the great Pandora Project that I've heard the Council go on about.

I ask her, "How close?"

Pandora looks at me as if she's unsure of my question.

I lean in and ask her, "I want to know if you two were playing between the sheets?"

Pandora's cheeks flush red, and I'm surprised by her bashfulness and how adorable she looks to be all flustered by my question. I try not to laugh but she's just so cute. I also find that this is an unusual quality for such a deadly project. Can she really be this embarrassed? She is! Ahhh... I want to take my hands and smush her face together, but Mr. Decuma has told me that I need to work on keeping my hands to myself. Mr. Decuma has tried to explain to me that there's such a thing as personal space, so I resist the urge.

Pandora still hasn't answered me, but she does shake her head and that makes me want to pry into her life even more. She's a project and I'm a project. Has her life been anything like mine?

The man in the distance, who's been talking to himself, continues to say, "A time to gain and a time to lose. A time to keep and a time to throw away. A time to tear and a time to sew."

"Really..?" I utter, responding to her shaking her head at me, and then I question, "Are you a lesbian?"

Pandora doesn't say anything at first as if she's taken aback by my question, but then she shakes her head and I'm about to ask her another personal question to see if I can't make her face turn even redder when she says to me in a hushed tone, "Umm... I think we should be quiet while the pastor is talking."

Pandora takes a few steps forward and away from me, and I wonder if she's going to try and leave me behind but she goes no farther.

The man who's been talking to himself this entire time still isn't done, and he says, "A time to keep silent and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate. A time of war and a time of peace."

He finally stops talking, and I'm so relieved. He was becoming annoying. He closes the book he's been reading from and picks up a handful of dirt.

"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust," he says and then sprinkles the dirt on the coffin and nods, and a man activates a machine that lowers the pine box.

Those gathered one by one throw a handful of dirt on the coffin.

I don't want my conversation with Pandora to be over, so I walk up to her and say, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything. I just can't imagine spending so much time with a guy and not–"

Pandora looks at me with this angry glare and puts a finger to her lips, hushing me.

"Right," I speak as I cover my mouth, and then I add in a quieter tone, "We should be quiet."
Chapter Twenty-one

Chad And Kat Meet Again

9:01 A.M...

Katharine's view...

One by one, those gathered at Preacher's funeral withdraw, leaving only a handful standing by the grave. I notice Chad stays, and I walk to him. He's wearing a black suit. I remove my backpack from around my shoulder and place the Bible in it.

Chad sees me approach and runs to me, throwing his arms around me as he shouts, "You made it." Tears stream down his face. "I thought you might not come."

"I'm here." I drop the backpack and hug him as I stroke his brown hair. "I'm here."

We stand there a few moments till Stephanie clears her throat.

Once I and Chad separate, she offers her hand to the boy as she says, "Hi, I'm Stephanie."

"Chad," he replies as he shakes her hand briefly and then wipes his eyes with the arm of his suit. "Are you a friend of Kat's?"

Stephanie's view...

I stare at the boy a few moments, wondering if I could be friends with Pandora. I don't see why not. We are both projects and there's no better way to know your enemy.

I answer the boy, "Yep, but we did just meet."

Katharine's view...

I continue to watch her. I still can't figure out why she's hanging around me instead of gathering with the others who have moved on.

"I almost forgot," Chad starts as he grabs my hand. "There's someone I want you to meet." He pulls me toward a woman with a little girl who has pretty black curly hair. Three men dressed in dark suits and wearing wireless earpieces move to intercept me as they start to draw their guns, but then Chad says, "It's okay, guys. She's my friend."

They cautiously look me and Stephanie over, and then one of them nods for us to proceed. Me and Chad walk up to the woman and the little girl.

Chad says, "This is Melissa Odin, Preacher's sister."

I reply, "I didn't know Preacher had a sister."

"Kat, it's good to meet you," Melissa states as she wipes her eyes with a tissue. "Though he was the black sheep, Preacher was the one who was ashamed of us, so I imagine that's why he never mentioned me."

Chad tells me, "Melissa is taking care of me now."

"Yes, I've taken Chad in through foster care. It was Preacher's idea. He said if anything should happen to him..." Melissa starts crying again.

Chad puts his arm around her and says, "Don't cry. Preacher's in a better place."

"I know. I miss him." She dabs her eyes again with the tissue, reaches her palm out, grabs my hand, and squeezes it. "I'm so glad you came. Chad was afraid you wouldn't. I tried to reassure him. If you were one of my brother's friends, you wouldn't let him down."

He bows his head as he admits, "I was only a little afraid."

One of the bodyguards steps forward and says, "Ms. Odin, we have been in the open far too long. We should get going."

"Mommy, I'm tired." The little girl rubs her eyes.

"All right dear. We'll head home now." Melissa kneels, picking up the child.

The little girl looks to me and asks, "Would you like to come over for a while? You could read me a story."

"I can't right now, but if it's okay–" I start as I turn to Melissa, "–I'd like to stop by tomorrow and see Chad."

Melissa nods and tells me, "I'll give you the address. Do you have an H.H.C.?"

"Yes." I remove a beat up one from my backpack and open up an address book on it. "Here."

Melissa takes it, types the address, hands it back to me, and then Melissa starts for a limo parked in the distance.

The little girl waves to the casket as she sleepily says, "Bye, Uncle Norman."

Two of the men in black suits follow Melissa and her little girl back to the limo.

Chad hugs me again. "I've missed you. I wish... I wish you could have stayed with us. I wish you could have stayed with me and Preacher." He steps back and says, "Maybe you could have stopped the man that..."

Chad can't finish the sentence; it must be too painful for him to say.

I put a hand to my mouth, hiding my trembling lips. Over and over I have thought the same thing. What if I had stayed? What if I had been in the Kitchen when the Closer came?

I kneel, look into his brown eyes, place my hand on his shoulder, and tell him, "Me too. How I wish I was, but you know it's not safe. People are hunting me."

Stephanie's view...

I look at Pandora curiously. Does she suspect me? Does she know why I'm here? Has she been playing the shy, easily embarrassed project only to lower my guard so that she can strike me first?

Katharine's view...

I glance at the man in the black suit and question the boy, "Why do you have bodyguards?"

He starts to answer, but then Melissa shouts, "Chad, come on."

"I'll tell you tomorrow." He runs toward the limo, and his bodyguard follows as Chad yells, "Make sure you come."

The bodyguard presses the button on his earpiece as he leaves and states, "I and the boy are moving toward the limo. The area's still clear."

I watch as Chad gets into the vehicle and the limo pulls away, and then I wait till I can't see the vehicle and turn to Stephanie. I don't think she's one of Preacher's friends, so I ask, "You said you knew Preacher, from where? I don't remember seeing you around Wayfaring Lane."

"Just around," Stephanie replies as she smirks, grabs my hand, and turns it so she can see the H.H.C. and the address. "I hate to rush off too but I've got somewhere to be. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow."

Stephanie heads back the way she came in past the gravestones, and she still carries the Transgenic Daisies. She's a very odd woman.

I turn to the hole Preacher lies in as the fog thickens around me. I mutter, "I don't know what to say to you. I believe, thanks to you, that this is not goodbye but till we meet again. Still..." I pick up a handful of dirt and throw it on his casket, and the dark soil thumps as it hits. "I miss you. I'll always miss you."

I stand there as a petroleum scented wind blows in and disperses the fog. I leave, make my way past the gravestones, and stop when one of them catches my eye. I walk to the gravestone and kneel beside it, reading, "Theresa Griffin. Beloved Mother. Cherished Wife. May She Rest In Peace."

I know only part of what Kimberly's going through. She believed her mom abandoned her, and then she discovered it was a lie and that her mom was murdered. I understand what it is to lose someone because someone else decided to take their life. I feel violated as though a thief came in and stole my happy existence and left me numb and hollow inside. I smooth my hand across Theresa's name. No wonder Kimberly's so driven to find whoever did this to her. I don't think killing them will ease her pain.

I carefully and lovingly clear the weeds from the front of the gravestone as if the woman was my own mom. I swear I'll help Kimberly find this person, but I don't know if I could stand there and let her kill them. If it's wrong for me to kill, shouldn't it be the same for Kimberly?

I pause in my thoughts as a presence disturbs my internal deliberation, and I look at the left without turning my head. Whoever's there, they're not bio-mechas. If they were, I would have detected their presence long before they got this close.

I stand, preparing for action as I shout, "I know you're there! Come out!"

I face two men as they move from hiding behind a tree, and they skittishly look around as they emerge.

"You?" I utter, relieved it's them and not a bounty hunter or a Closer. "Why are you two here?"

"Argus sent us," the older of the two men replies as if he's a little nervous to be here. "I don't know if we ever introduced ourselves but I'm Maxwell." He points to his partner. "And this is Peters."

"So you made it out. Is Argus all right?" I ask.

"Yes," Peters answers. "Argus has a few cracked ribs and a lot of bruising, but for the most part, he'll be fine."

I walk over to them as they haven't gotten any closer to me, and then I say, "You said he sent you."

Maxwell's still very nervous as he glances around to make sure no one's about, and then he pulls an object from his coat pocket. "He wanted us to give this back to you."

He offers me a Beretta, and I take the gun.

Peters says, "It's not the one you loaned us, but Argus thought you would like the same model back. He said you might have gotten used to a certain piece of hardware."

"Tell him thanks when you see him." I eject the magazine, find it full, and add, "You even returned it with a few extra rounds."

Peters nudges Maxwell and motions to me with his head as he urges him, "Go on."

"We actually wanted to thank you," Maxwell starts. "We would have died in the Factory if you had not of released us. The T-3s killed everyone else. It was only a matter of time before they decided we should follow our co-workers."

"No thanks needed. You would have saved me if I were in your position."

They glance at each other as if they're guilty of something.

Maxwell's nervousness is replaced by something that seems more like remorse than thankfulness as he replies, "Right. We would have saved you."

"We actually need to be going," Peters states as he scans the graveyard. "Our new masters don't let us out for very long."

"Your new masters?"

Peters tells me, "We now work for the Council. After the collapse of the Factory, they acquired all their assets, including us."

The word "them" screams in my mind as I tighten my jaw, holding back my anger. Why can't they leave me alone? What right do they have to mess with my life?

Both men must notice the change in my demeanor because they start to act a little afraid of me.

"Well, see you around," Maxwell says as he quickly waves good-bye and motions with his head for Peters to follow him, and they walk off.

I look at the Beretta and say softly, "Thanks, Argus."

I head out of the graveyard and start for Nexus Apartments, pleased I did it. I was here for Chad. He didn't have to...

"Oh, no!" I shout as I stop and glance back.

How could I forget? I open my backpack, put the gun in it, and remove the book. I should have given Preacher's Bible to Melissa. I'd been so caught up in the moment, I'd forgotten. No harm done. I can do it tomorrow. I continue out of the graveyard. Melissa should have it. She's Preacher's sister.
Chapter Twenty-two

Genesis Arboretum

11:07 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

A lone moth fluttered in the dark heavens. The yellow, orange, and brown bug flew down, entered Zeus Park, and landed on a leaf of a Transgenic Maple. The Death's Head Hawkmoth crawled over the lighter green side of the leaf, flaunting the skull-like pattern on its thorax, and there it watched all. Across the street at the Nexus Apartments, a red VX Corvette pulled out of the parking garage and turned on to West 1000 Avenue, and the Death's Head Hawkmoth took back to the air, flew high in the sky, and followed the car.

A half hour later...

Kimberly's view...

I drive through Arts Way and pass several galleries and museums as many people stroll the dark sidewalks under the yellow glow of the Cultural Vicinage's streetlights. I know very little about the mysterious woman sitting beside me and yet, I let her into my apartment.

I grip the steering wheel as this drive gives me time to consider everything that's happened to me since that woman came into my life. Irritation is the first word I think of when I look at her, but I can think of a few more words. Annoyance... Trouble... Headache... Idiot...

Hades! My life has changed so much since she appeared. Sometimes... I glance at her again. Sometimes I wish I never met her and that all I have to worry about is my next Closing.

Katharine's view...

Gloom wraps its arms around me as I stare out the side window, watching the people as they go about their lives. They have a normal life, but do they wish for a different existence? Do they long for something else?

My thoughts change and drift back to earlier when I was at Preacher's funeral. I can't figure out why Stephanie was there. I know it wasn't for Preacher. She didn't even leave the flowers she brought. I recall her manner. She acted like no assassin I have ever run across. Could she be a bio-mecha or maybe an organic-mecha? I don't know. If Stephanie's after me, she should have tried to kill me. It was like she was waiting for something. Maybe I should tell Kimberly about her.

I at least need to tell her about her mom's tombstone, so I softly speak, knowing the difficulty of this subject, "Kimberly."

"Hmm..." she states as she glances at me and then turns her attention back to the road.

"While I was at Hades Cemetery, I... I came across your mom's grave."

"Oh," she replies. "Sure, I'd forgotten my father said she was buried there." Kimberly's quiet for a few moments, and then she asks me, "How was the grave? Was it kept up? Did it have flowers?"

She must not have visited the grave yet. I can only think that it must be too painful.

"No flowers," I answer. "But it is being kept up, and it's in a nice spot near a tree."

"Oh," Kimberly states as she pulls on her left earlobe. "I'll have to go visit her one day."

Her reaction surprises me. I expected more from her. Kimberly's a very private person. I'm not sure what I expected. Maybe some yelling or some sign of anger. Is she holding it in? If so, what will happen when she erupts like a volcano? I sigh. I just hope I'm not around when she explodes.

Kimberly drives on in silence and after a few more quiet minutes, she directs the car into the Genesis Arboretum's large parking lot. Both of us get out of the car and stretch after the long ride. Over a hundred vehicles fill the spaces and in the distance, people walk in and out of the main building. A tram stops at a pickup station, waits as people board, and then drives to the main entrance. We board the next tram which comes by about five minutes later, and then we exit the tram at the main building and enter the Genesis Arboretum. We stand in line with about twelve people. I keep getting this sense that... I'm not sure what it is, but I glance back at a mountain of a man in line about four people back. I've never seen him before and try not to stare as Kimberly purchases our tickets at a window. We walk over and hand an employee our tickets, and we enter through the turnstiles.

"Wait a second," I say as I stop at a gift cart and glance back to the ticket line.

"We can shop when we're done," Kimberly tells me. "And I'm not buying you any souvenirs."

Back in the line, the man I had seen with a buzz cut steps to the window and buys two tickets. He steps out of line and shouts, "I have them. We may enter now."

A woman about Kimberly's age walks over to him, wraps her arm around his, and says, "I am so pleased we were able to come here. Even though I hate this dreadful Dark Half, I am very interested in Transgenics, and they have hundreds of tree and plant specimens here."

They continue talking as they walk past us at the gift cart.

He glances at us, and then he says to the woman with him, "Then let us take our time and stroll through the Arboretum."

I watch the couple as they pass, and I get this feeling that I should be very afraid of them.

"Don't stare," Kimberly scolds me. "It's very impolite."

I move to her side and whisper, "But he's carrying a gun."

"I know. It's still impolite to stare. Anyway..." Kimberly starts as something on the gift cart catches her attention, and she picks up a keychain of a bunny rabbit. "A lot of people have guns. It doesn't mean they're after you. They could have it for protection or they could be pursuing someone else. You're not the only person hunted in this world."

"I know but still... I have to be cautious," I state as I continue to watch the couple. "And besides, he isn't the only one armed. The woman also has weapons on her wrists."

Kimberly glances at the woman, trying not to be obvious and says, "Good eye. I had not noticed."

I watch the couple as they stroll into the next room, and then I state, "Maybe they're throwing weapons like darts or knives."

"Come on," Kimberly tells me as she places the keychain back and starts in the opposite direction the couple went. "They have nothing to do with us."

End Katharine's view...

Once they were some distance away, Natasha told her brother, "I believe those women were staring at you."

"I believe you are right. The plain looking one kept staring at me when they were in line for tickets." Nikolai went into his gangster mode and said, "The broads mean nuttin' to me. Honest. I have eyes only for you."

Natasha grinned as she spoke, "As you should."

Katharine's view...

Me and Kimberly follow the path lined with Transgenic Plant exhibits till we come across an employee, and Kimberly asks him, "Excuse me. Does Adam Greenhouse work here?"

"Yes," he replies as he points down the path. "Keep going. Mr. Greenhouse's lecturing around the bend."

We continue across the path till we come to a group of about a dozen people listening to a cotton-white haired man who towers over the crowd almost a good two feet. He wears a blue flannel shirt and jean overalls.

"That's him," I say, excited to find the one we've been searching for. "That's Mr. Greenhouse." I look him over real good, and then I add with a hint of surprise, "He looks just like his picture."

Kimberly's view...

I ignore her comment. Finding him was easy and now all we have to do is wait till he's done talking. I watch Mr. Greenhouse hobble along with a silver serpent-head cane. Hades... What is he like a hundred years old?

Adam slowly moves to a Transgenic Maple and his cane thumps as he walks across the concrete floor, and then he pats the tree's trunk and explains, "It is widely published that the first Transgenic Plant was the cross between the tobacco and the lantern fish. The report is in fact, not true. The Transgenic Maple was the first, and so it is the Prime." He coughs, removes a red handkerchief from his pocket, and wipes his mouth before he continues, "I wanted to create a Transgenic Tree or hybrid that could survive without the sun, so I created this species by genetically modifying a Red Maple with the extra-genome of a firefly, yielding a tree whose trunk and branches produce its own light." Adam takes a deep breath and wheezes as he exhaled, and then he says, "Not only is this tree the Prime, it is also the most abundant Transgenic in Noir." He places both hands on his cane to steady himself as he asks, "Any questions?"

I impatiently stand there as he answers their inquiries for about twenty minutes and then when the crowd disperses, Adam turns and starts to leave through a door in the back.

"Excuse me, Mr. Greenhouse," I call out to him as I move towards the man who stands seven foot nine inches and has pale blue eyes. I don't think I've ever met someone this tall, but I put my awestruck reaction aside and ask him, "Could I have a moment of your time?"

He pauses, turns to me, and says, "You're a lovely one, sapling." His face brightens as he peers down at me as if I'm not the first giddy fan he's come across which I'm definitely not, and he tells me, "Sorry, no autographs at this time."

"My name's Kimberly," I begin as I point to myself, trying to make it clear I'm not here for his autograph. "I'm Theresa Griffin's daughter."

"Theresa..?" Adam repeats as he squints and looks me over. "Yes, I see it now. I should have before. I guess I'm getting old." He turns, continues to the door, bends down so his head clears the frame, and walks through as he says, "Come with me, please."

I walk after him and that woman follows, and then I notice the nameplate beside the door with Sapling Room written on it. We continue down a small hall into a rectangular room lit by sunlamps and within, there are thousands of pots of young Transgenic trees and flowers and other non-Transgenic plants. There are a hundred or so rows of these pots.

Adam leans his cane on a work table that's covered with gardening tools, and he turns an overhead light on as he speaks, "Let me have a look at you." He moves over to me and walks slowly around me as he states, "I see it. The spitting image of your mother." He rubs his white stubbly chin as if contemplating the lack of recognition on his part as he mumbles, "I don't know why I didn't notice before. You look just like Theresa when we first met."

"Did you work with my mom?" I ask, happy for the first time in a long time to be talking with someone besides my father who knew my mom. Adam might even know what happened to her.

"Actually..." he replies as he puts a finger to his lips in a hush-hush manner. "She worked for me on a top secret project."

"On organic-mecha?" that woman questions him as she breaks her silence and steps forward.

Adam glances at her and looks back to me, mumbling, "Not so top secret, I see."

"Mr. Greenhouse, I need to know something," I state, angry over a sexless figure I can't quite make out, and then I inquire of him, "Did you know that my mom was murdered?"

He bows his head and deeply sighs as if I affirmed his suspicions, and then he says, "It is as I thought."

I grip my knapsack, thinking of all the things I'll do to this unseen person once I find them, and I state, "I'm searching for who did it and–"

"And the why?" Adam interrupts.

"No, the why doesn't matter unless it leads me to who did it," I answer, and I speak the truth. I don't care why they did what they did. They will pay... they will pay with their life.

"I see," Adam says as he walks over to the work table and grabs his cane. "Why have you come to see me?"

"A clue led me to Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo and there I found a book," I start to explain as I hold out my hand, and then I jiggle it when that woman doesn't react to my unspoken but very obvious request. I wait a few more moments and when that woman still doesn't react, I snap, "For Ares' sake! The book!"

"Huh? Oh... You want me to–" that woman responds and then she rummages through her backpack and removes the Transgenic Text. She hands it to me and says, "–give you the book."

I continue in a calmer voice once I have the text in hand, "The book led me to you."

I hand the text to him, and Adam takes it, then turns it over, and studies the photo of himself as if it's the first time he's seeing it.

"It was so long ago," he says. "The Sphinx Corporation assigned Theresa to me back then, and it was her first job with the corporation."

"What did you work on?"

"At first, Theresa helped me engineer Transgenic Plants and then later, we were both placed on the organic-mecha project," Adam tells me.

"Was it the Gorgons?" I question.

"No, I never worked on that project," Adam replies, but I believe I hear a hint of deceit in his answer, and then he squints, getting a better look at that woman who's standing beside me as if he sees something in her that I can't see. "The organic-mechas were under another project name."

"What would that be?" I ask.

He turns his attention back to me and answers, "Sorry sapling, some secrets do need to be kept."

"Were you successful with the organic-mecha?" that woman speaks up again with a question of her own.

"You could say we were, but organic-mechas were long ago abandoned as a viable weapon," Adam replies as he eyes that woman again but with more scrutiny. "There were too many problems with the organic-mechas."

"We did find one file at Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo," I state as I hold out my hand again to that woman and this time, she quickly removes the Lost File and gives it to me. I tell Adam as I hand him the file, "Most of it doesn't make sense."

Adam takes the file folder, flips through it, and chuckles as if he's amused by our lack of understanding when it comes to what's written inside, and then he speaks, "Like I said, some secrets need to remain hidden, but I will tell you one thing. The Sphinx Corporation hides information in plain sight, and one of their methods is to change the Greek name to their Roman counterpart."

He hands the file back, and I take it a little irked to have been laughed at by some ridiculously-old man.

"This trip is a waste of my time."

Adam questions me, "Was it?"

That woman taps me on the shoulder, then motions to him with her head, and says, "Ask him about your hand. Maybe he knows more."

"My hand?" I repeat as I glance at my right palm, and then I show the star to him and say, "Oh, right. Do you know what this mark is?"

He takes my hand in his large shaky ones, examines the mark, and then answers, "I believe that is Ginn's Cipher or what is known as a Star Cipher." He raises a bushy white eyebrow and questions me, "How did you get this mark?"

"From a doorknob," I reply. "It was hot from an office fire, and it burned me and left me with this scar."

I watch him as sweat beads his liver-spotted forehead, and he states, "Heat would make a very good catalyst." I hear the excitement in his voice as he questions me, "Do you know where the knob is now?"

"No."

"A pity," Adam states as he releases my hand. "I would like to study one of the objects that has the star mark."

He pulls out his red handkerchief and throws it in a trash can, and then he walks over to the work table, removes a new handkerchief from a package, and wipes his face.

I follow him and start to mention the music box when that woman touches my back, and I turn as she shakes her head, frantically pleading with her expression for me to say nothing. I'm not sure if Adam notices this, but I do remain quiet about the music box that woman has.

"You said catalyst," I say to change the subject somewhat, and then I ask, "What did you mean?"

"In your case, the cipher was not imprinted by a burn but by a virus that reconfigured the epidermis on a micro-level."

"I'm not sure I understand what you mean."

"It is simple, sapling. You came in contact with a virus that genetically alters a localized area. The virus was designed to create the raised star in the center of the palm." He points to the star as he says, "It doesn't matter where you were infected, the virus was designed to place the micro-cipher there in the center."

That woman questions him, "Did the Sphinx Corporation create it?"

Adam laughs at her remark, and then he answers, "In fact, no. Ginn did." He throws the second handkerchief away, grabs the third one from the package, and places it in his pocket. "How is it delivered? I suspect Ginn put the viruses on different objects, and they lay dormant until some catalyst activates them." He deeply breathes in again and wheezes before saying, "It's a pity you don't know where the knob is. I would have liked to–"

"Did you say the composer created it?" that woman interrupts him.

"Yes, scientist believe Ginn L. Irynkissgthie created the virus five hundred years ago," Adam replies as he leans on his cane with both hands. "They believe he's really the Father of Genetics among other things."

"Composer, painter," that woman mutters. "Ginn's credentials are growing."

I ask, "What are the ciphers for?"

"Ciphers?" he repeats in a cackled. "Sapling, you're lucky to see the one. There has never been two or more in a generation. In fact, there have only been three others in the past five hundred years." He stares at my hand as if he can see the cipher on my palm, and then he says, "If we were to have more than one at a time, that would mean something." He turns his attention to my face as he states, "As to what they are for... I believe they hold some sort of code or map. I'm not sure. The cipher wasn't my department. Whatever it holds can't be seen even at a subatomic level. You could say the enigma is encoded."

That woman speaks, "You said to have more than one at a time would mean something." She places her left hand in her pocket, I assume to hide it from him as she questions, "What does it mean?"

Adam shrugs and answers, "I guess that Ginn's Prophecy is coming true. Wouldn't that be something?"

"What prophecy?" that woman inquires.

Adam had mostly ignored that woman since we came in, but now he turns to her and studies her face as he answers, "You'll have to find another to tell you that, you see this old man is going to bed." Adam studies her face a little longer, and then he starts for a door in the back and says, "The Sphinx Corporation who owns this place has been good enough to let me live here. You should come visit me sometime in my treehouse. It's in the next area called the Sphere Room." He opens the door and starts through it as he adds, "But not today."

Adam leaves, and I'm left with more unanswered questions than when I first came here.

That woman waits until he exits, and then she asks me, "Now what?"

"Now we go home," I reply as I peer at the folder I hold. "Do some research on the internet."

I start out the way we came in.

That woman follows me, and we leave the Sapling Room as she states, "Okay, but I can't stay up too late."

"Why's that?"

"I have to go visit Chad tomorrow," she answers me.

"Him again. Just how old is this guy?"

"He's twelve. Why do you ask?" that woman questions me with some stupid grin on her face, and then she asks me, "Looking for a date?"

"Funny," I say and sneer at her. "Let's go."

We return to the entrance and walk by the couple who had caught that woman's attention.

She glances at the couple and then must remember how I told her it was impolite to stare, so she turns her attention back to me and says, "Kimberly, do you remember when I pointed out Adam? Do you remember when I said he looked just like his picture?"

"Sure," I reply, then shrug, and ask, "What about it?"

"I really meant it. Adam hasn't changed. He hasn't aged and looks exactly like his picture, and we know it was taken more than thirty years ago. Why hasn't he gotten older?"

"How am I supposed to know? Maybe he has an excellent plastic surgeon."

"I'm serious. He hasn't aged."

"Oh for Ares' sake! Don't you think we have enough on our plate without searching for his Fountain of Youth?"

"We did get Florida when Ponce de Leon looked for the original," that woman tells me. "Maybe we can get something of equal value if we look for Adam's Fountain."

Why is that woman always talking in riddles? I was never very good in history, but Ponce de Leon and Christopher Columbus discovered Noir or the Neoteric World as it was called back then. I've never even heard of this Florida that she mentioned.
Chapter Twenty-three

Brownstone Street

October 24...

Sunday...

8:41 A.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

In a large cage beside the Bes Hotel, birds in a rainbow of colors chirped to an artificial morning. The hotel built a glass and steel aviary next to their main building so guest could walk out of the lobby into the center of a mock rainforest, and several lamps generated the sun of the Light Side. One of the upbeat regions of Noir, the upper-class part of the Nile Sector called the Commorance Vicinage, produced a wealth of hotels, fine restaurants, high-class shops, and large residential properties. Business people and retail employees filled the sidewalks as they made their way to work, and children played along the well-lit streets. A few dogs barked as their owners took them on walks, and a white Commercial Class He-Zeppelin glided over the brightly lit city. The helium-filled airship's twin engines roared, cutting through the thick atmosphere. Oxygen cells fed clean air directly into the intake valve, keeping the engines running in the polluted sky. A message in green neon letters ran across the He-Zeppelin's side, and it read, "Buy Valhalla Water, the liquid from heaven. It comes from the purest source, underground springs in Iceland. So Buy Valhalla Water, H2O of the gods."

Katharine's view...

Cars and trucks drive up and down the busy Brownstone Street in front of the Bes Hotel. I get out of a taxi and walk up to the stoop belonging to Melissa's address. The house's across the street from the hotel. Earlier, I took a hovertrain to reach this part of Noir and then grabbed the taxi, thanks to Kimberly's credits that she uncharacteristically allowed me to use with no fuss. I notice a black van with dark tinted windows parked near Bes, and I panic. I want to dart back into the taxi that's still sitting at the curb. I can't do this. I can't let my paranoia get ahold of me. The Council and the Factory can no longer track me, so it's just a van. No one's after me and once I think I've convinced myself, I move to the front door, keeping a watchful eye on the van. I remove the white Bible from my backpack and ring the doorbell.

I wait but before anyone answers, Stephanie walks up behind me out of nowhere and says, "Hello again." She wears a similar outfit as she had before, but this time the smiley face on her t-shirt has a bullet hole in the center of its forehead and blood trickles down from the cartoon wound.

"Hello," I reply more wary of her than the van.

Stephanie must notice my suspicious gaze and tries to divert my mistrust by asking, "Are you also here to see Preacher's sister?"

The black van across the street draws my attention again as two men in white uniforms and caps exit, head for the rear of the vehicle, and open the two back doors. I turn my attention back to Stephanie as we stand on the stoop. I'm feeling a bit unsettled around her. Our meeting before at the cemetery and our meeting again now seems too much of a coincidence.

"I've come to see Melissa," I tell her.

"Me too," Stephanie replies as she glances at what I was looking at, probably spots the van, and turns back to me. "Can't wait to see Chuck again."

She doesn't even know his name, so I correct her by stating, "Chad."

"Huh..?"

"His name's Chad," I repeat as I glance over Stephanie and see no evidence of any weapons on her person, but she's carrying a bright yellow backpack large enough for several.

"Right, Chad."

The two men at the van distract me once again, and I look at them as they unload a large rectangular crate. Another black van pulls up behind the first, and two more men in white uniforms exit the second vehicle.

I hear a noise, turn, and look up from my spot on the stoop to see the security camera mounted on the wall above us turn to get a better view of us. I face the camera right before a man speaks over the intercom.

"Can I help you?"

"I'm Kat. I'm here to see Melissa and Chad."

A bodyguard with a blond ponytail and wearing a black suit opens the door. I stand there and gape at him for a few moments. He looks so much like Argus that I think it's him at first. The bodyguard's resemblance to Argus unsettles me, and I become a mute. A second bodyguard with brown, wavy, shoulder length hair stands behind him and has his gun drawn. I recognize the second bodyguard to be one of the ones from the funeral.

The first bodyguard, the one who looks like Argus, presses the button on his earpiece and speaks, "Johnson, Andrews here. There are two female guests at the door. One's named Kat." Andrews nods as he listens, then turns to the other bodyguard, and says, "Daniels, Ms. Odin says to let them in."

Daniels holsters his gun, retrieves a metal detector wand, turns to me, and orders, "Lift your arms please." He runs the wand up and down my body as he asks, "Are you carrying any weapons?"

The metal detector beeps as he runs it over my bag, and I'm so stunned by the other guard's uncanny resemblance to Argus, I don't answer his question at first. The metal detector continues to go off, drawing me from my gawk, and I finally answer, "I have a gun. It's in my backpack."

"I'll need you to hand it over before I can let you in," Daniels tells me.

I remove the Beretta and hand the gun to him. Daniels takes the Beretta and puts the weapon in a drawer of an entry table. He locks the drawer with a key and places the key in his pants pocket, and then Daniels returns, runs the wand over me again, and then moves to Stephanie.

"Lift your arms," Daniels orders and when she does, he runs the wand up and down her body, and the wand detects no metal. "Do you have any weapons?"

"No, nothing," she answers.

"I need your bags," he tells both of us.

We hand him our packs with no objections.

Andrews points to my hand and questions me, "What's that?"

"A Bible. It belonged to Preacher, so I brought it for Melissa."

"I didn't know she was religious," Daniels comments as he holds out his hand. "I'll need to see it." He takes the book, flips through it, hands it back to me, and says, "I'll need to pat both of you down."

"Of course," I state as I slightly lift my arms.

He frisks me and then Stephanie, and then he speaks, "They're clear."

Andrews presses the button on his earpiece and relays, "Johnson, we're bringing the women into the house."

"Follow me," Daniels orders as he leads us through the entry to a white and black checkered tile living room.

Ahead of us and to the right is a staircase leading up to the middle of an open second floor. On the left, a large sectional white leather couch in the shape of a C is positioned in front of a huge TV. Chad's there and my heart and mind relax when I see him. He looks up from a video game and runs over to me and in his excitement, he kicks a baseball glove to a metal bat he'd laid by the TV.

"You came!" Chad exclaims as I see he's wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and jeans.

I wrap my arms around the excited boy, and then I ask, "Is Melissa here?"

"I'm here," Melissa replies as she walks in from the kitchen, drying her hands on an apron, and she's wearing a light gray dress with a flower pattern.

I'm so happy to see him again. I never really got a chance at the funeral to feel joy and happiness, so I take that moment to soak them both in.

I finish basking in my selfish delight, then walk over to Melissa, and tell her, "I brought you this." I hold up the book and tell her, "It was Preacher's. I think he would want you to have it."

Melissa looks to the worn leather cover and stares at it for a few moments. I can see sadness in her expression but there's something more, and she takes a step back, not from me but the Bible as she utters, "No."

Her reaction bewilders me, and I wonder if I see hatred in her expression and if so, what is her hatred aimed at? Preacher's killer or Preacher himself?

Melissa takes another step back and in a calmer tone, she tells me, "I think you should keep it. He would want you to keep it." She nods as if it's the solution to a problem she has, and she repeats, "Yes, you keep it."

Either way, I don't care what her reason is. I get to keep it.

"Thank you," I tell Melissa.

I place the book against my chest, grateful I have something of Preacher's, so I'll never forget him.

Stephanie's view...

I look at the book with interest. Pandora must have really loved the guy, too bad he's dead. He could have been useful to my plans. I glance around at those gathered here. I'll need to find someone else I can use to exploit this weakness I see in Pandora. She seems to care about people beyond what she can use them for. I'm betting it'll be the boy.

Katharine's view...

Melissa remains in her standoffish pose till she notices Chad's watching her, and then her expression changes as she asks, "Anyone for chocolate chip cookies? They're hot out of the oven. I know it's a little early in the morning, but it's a special occasion."

"Yeah, me!" Chad yells, dashing into the kitchen.

Melissa turns to the bodyguards and questions them, "Andrews... Daniels... What about you two?"

"No, thank you," they both answer.

Melissa turns back to me and Stephanie, and she instructs us, "Come on, ladies. Before the boy eats them all."

The three of us walk into the kitchen. The heavenly aroma of baking dough and chocolate hits me, and my mouth waters, envisioning the scrumptious dessert hitting my taste buds. Melissa's little girl and Chad sit on barstools around a rosewood granite island. The island's in the middle of the large kitchen with matching tile floors. The third bodyguard's bald and stands off in the corner, and I recognize him as one of the bodyguards who was at the funeral. I sit next to Chad, and he and the little girl dunk their cookies in glasses of milk. Stephanie watches them as if they're performing a bizarre ritual and then sits beside me.

"Would you like coffee?" Melissa asks us. "There's a fresh pot."

"If it's okay, I'd like to have milk," I tell her.

"Sure," Melissa replies and then she turns to Stephanie. "What about you?"

"Coffee," she answers. "Black."

"Coming right up," Melissa speaks as she goes to work and after some time, Melissa places a small glass of milk in front of me and a mug of coffee in front of Stephanie. Melissa sets a plate in front of each of us and grabs a metal sheet pan from the stove top with an oven mitt. She takes a spatula, removes a cookie from the sheet pan, and places it on a plate, and she repeats this till each of us has two.

I watch Stephanie with growing curiosity as she picks up the cookie, examines it intensely, watches the children's food diving ritual, then dunks her own in her coffee, and bites into it. Her blue-green eyes widened as she swallows and says, "Mmm... This is good."

I continue watching her as I still try to figure out why she's really here. Preacher's sister has a security detail. Could it have anything to do with that? Could she be after Melissa and not me?

I take a bite of my warm ooey-gooey cookie and nearly moan for how good it is. I dunk my cookie in my milk and enjoy the rare treat. I start on my second cookie and say between bites, "You don't know me very well Melissa, but I hope you don't mind me asking. Why do you have bodyguards?"

Stephanie seems to perk up with interest after she devours both of her chocolate chip cookies.

Melissa turns to the children and says, "Chad, why don't you take Bonnie up to her room to play while I talk with Kat?"

"Yes, Melissa. Come on, Bonnie. Let's go play in your room."

Melissa waits till the children leave and hears them walk up the stairs, and then she places the sheet pan and spatula on the counter and tells me, "My contract with the Valhalla Corporation is in dispute." Melissa sits on the barstool across from me and continues, "You see, I'm a chemist and after my ten-year term ended with the corporation, I left. One year after that, I started a new job and developed a formula, and Valhalla claims they are entitled to anything I may have started while in their employment, but I never began work on this formula until I started my new job. The corporation I work for now, Isis, sent these bodyguards to protect me and my family until the delegation in court is over. Valhalla has no legal claims, but Isis fears they might convince the Assassins Guild to send a Life Closer after me, so I have these men here until the matter is settled." She looks up at the ceiling as if envisioning the upstairs and the children as she says, "This place isn't my house but a safe house."

I peer at Stephanie who has downed another cookie she snuck from the sheet pan, and then I turn back to Melissa and say, "You said today was a special occasion. What is it?"

"Oh, no. Did you forget?"

I have no clue, so I say, "Did I forget what?"

"It's Chad's birthday," Melissa proclaims.
Chapter Twenty-four

Break Down Of Security

9:14 A.M...

Minutes earlier...

On Brownstone Street...

The four delivery men made their way across the road and up the stoop of Melissa's house, and then one of them removed his white cap, wiped sweat from his brow, and rang the doorbell. The security camera turned to see the two large rectangular crates the men had wheeled up on dollies.

Andrews asked through the intercom, "Can I help you?"

One of the men looked at an H.H.C., and then he said, "We have a delivery for a Melissa Odin from Isis Corporation."

Inside the house...

Andrews glanced at Daniels, who checked his H.H.C.

"We are expecting them," Daniels said. "Let them in."

Andrews went out, ran the wand over each man, frisked them, and found nothing. He opened the door for them and told them, "Set the crates at the end of the entry and unload them."

The four men started in as one of the men said, "There are three more crates, and they should be arriving shortly."

Inside the kitchen...

Katharine's view...

Chad's birthday? How could I forget?

I think back a year ago, and it almost seems like yesterday. It had been fifteen days since I met Chad and the day before, Preacher told me it was going to be the boy's birthday, so we were going to surprise him.

31 A.D.C...

November 7...

Saturday...

Chad entered the Kitchen and made his way to his cot. Sweat soaked his sweatshirt, and he held a worn basketball under his arm.

"Have a good game?" I questioned him as I sat up on my cot and nodded to Preacher across the room, and he left to get one of the surprises for the boy.

"Not bad, but the Kitchen's basketball has seen its last game. It keeps losing air. Can't really play with a ball that doesn't bounce."

"Oh..." I said. "Guess not."

"You up to playing some cards with me?" Chad questioned me. "I was hoping we might play–"

"I don't know," I interrupt him, being a little wicked. I know what the surprises were and how much Chad would enjoy them, so I pretended that I didn't know it was his birthday. I lay back as if I didn't have a care in the world and said, "I'm kind of tired. Maybe I'll go to bed early." I rolled on my side, faced him, and rested my head on my elbow as I asked, adding to my evilness, "Today isn't some sort of special day, is it?"

I watched as Preacher came up behind the boy with a chocolate cupcake with a single lit candle in it. I tried not to laugh as Preacher tiptoed all the way.

"No," Chad lied, and then he sulked as he added, "Not really."

I sat up, changing my pretend bored face to one of sheer excitement as I accused him, "I think you're wrong."

I pointed behind the boy, and Chad turned and saw the cupcake as me and Preacher broke out in song.

"It's your birthday!" we sang off tune. "It's your birthday! It's a special day. It's a special day." We shouted loudly, "Happy birthday Chad!"

The boy smiled and that made my day, and Chad asked, "Are you trying to make my ears bleed?"

"Blow the candle out already, smart guy," Preacher told him as he handed the cupcake to the boy.

Chad took it, closed his eyes, and blew out the small flame.

"Why did you close your eyes?" I questioned.

"I made a wish. One I can't tell you."

"Go ahead eat the cupcake," Preacher said.

Chad removed the paper cup as he explained to me, "You're supposed to make a wish when you blow out your candles." He bit into the chocolate and asked through a mouthful, "Don't you on your birthday?"

"I don't know. I don't know when my birthday is," I admitted.

"Really..? Why don't we make it in two weeks?" he suggested as he wiped his mouth with his hand. "Won't that be cool?"

I looked at Preacher, and he told me, "It's up to you, Kat."

"Okay. My birthday will be in two weeks and now for the other part of your celebration." I pulled out a large paper sack, handed it to him, and exclaimed, "Your present!"

"A present? Really..?" Chad uttered as he quickly opened it. "A basketball. And it's new! Wow! Thanks."

In the present...

The memory fades as I state, "Wait... It isn't his birthday, not for another two weeks."

"I know, but I wanted to have some laughter and some fun memories for the boy to remember–" Melissa begins as her eyes become distant, "–in case..."

Johnson left earlier and walks back in, interrupting her statement as he says, "The packages have arrived."

Melissa takes a deep breath, composing herself, and then she says, "The Isis Corporation said they would be sending them over."

Johnson informs her, "Daniels is going to give Andrews a hand. He's better with that computer stuff than I am."

Stephanie's view...

I watch Pandora and study her expressions, her reactions, and her interactions with these people. She's not anything like I thought she would be, so this is the Council's great hope for the ultimate killer.

I chuckle, and Pandora glances at me, so I wipe my mouth with a napkin and say, "Yummy cookies."

Katharine's view...

I'm not sure how to take Stephanie. I can't tell if she's a threat or only an annoyance. She seems to be dogging me, and I can't figure out why. I should just ask Melissa if she knows Stephanie. I should... I force those thoughts to the side as something else bothers me. A warning like a distant drum sounding moments before a battle starts resounds in my mind. Good with computers...

I turn to Melissa and ask, "What kind of packages did the Isis Corporation send over?"

"Bio-mechas," Melissa informs me as she grabs a cookie. "Why do you ask?"

"Crap!" I curse as I stand, and then I demand, "What type?"

"Un-Men," Johnson answers as he seems concerned with my agitation. "Isis bought a few from the Sphinx Cor–"

"No," I interrupt him as the panic I tried to suppress outside comes hysterically back. I run out of the kitchen and shout to the bodyguards in the living room, "Don't activate them!"

Stephanie, Melissa, and Johnson follow after me a few seconds later.

I rush into the living room and find Andrews and Daniels standing alongside five Un-men, two T-1s and three T-2s. The Un-Men wear no ORATT like they normally do to hide their eyes so that they can pass as human. I think about darting for the front door and bolting from the house before they power up, but the Un-Men block the entry, so I shout again, "Don't activate them!"

I quickly turn my attention to the locked entry table where my gun's stowed. I'll be defenseless if they power up. I have to make sure they don't activate the Un-Men. I race for the bodyguards, but Daniels must not have heard me because he taps the activation button, the H.H.C. wirelessly transmits the command, and the Un-Men come to life.

My heart beats the bio-mecha warning as my body prepares for combat, and I feel the blue Ult L-E shimmer from my eyes. I turn, race back, and frantically question Melissa, "Do you have a back door?"

"By Thor!" Melissa exclaims as she gasps. "Your eyes!"

Stephanie's view...

I nearly salute her as I peer at Pandora in awe. What's happening to her? What's this amazing thing that's happening to her? Her eyes have changed... no her eyes are glowing with this power that I envy. Am I about to witness something spectacular? Am I about to see why the Council believes Pandora is a better project than me?

Katharine's view...

I glance back as the Un-Men state in one accord, "Unit activated. Uploading new programming. Please standby. The program will be uploaded in twenty seconds."

"Melissa!" I yell and then repeat, "Do you have a back door?"

Johnson steps forward, placing himself between me and Melissa as he says, "I think you need to settle down and take a few steps back. There's something wrong with you. Are you some sort of bio-mecha?"

I glance back again as the Un-Men turn their heads, stare right at me, and say in unison, "Pandora Project detected. Bypassing new software. Initializing original commands. Commencing Seek and Destroy Program." They move forward as they declare, "We will annihilate the Pandora Project."

"What are you doing? I didn't command any of you to move," Daniels shouts. "And what's this Pandora Project?" He taps a few keys on the H.H.C. touch screen, and then he announces, "We have defective bio-mechas. No wonder the Isis Corporation got them so cheap. We'll have to shut them down." He presses a few more keys, and I hear a little fear in his voice as he says, "They aren't turning off!"

"The door!" I utter as I move past Johnson and grab Melissa's arms so she'll focus on me, and I scream, "I need to leave now! Where's the door?"

Johnson grabs me by my arm as he places his other hand on his holstered gun, and he orders me, "I think you need to back up."

Andrews, who's also by the Un-Men, leans over, glances at Daniels' H.H.C. screen, and points as he suggests, "Try the override command."

"I did," Daniels tells him. "They aren't responding. I'll pull up the emergency termination. It'll burn out their processor, but it can't be helped now."

The Un-Men draw their guns out of their shoulder holsters.

"Hurry!" Andrews shouts.

"There, got it!" Daniels yells as he presses the final button.

The Un-Men pause in mid-action as if they're a video and then their dot-lights fade, and I'm so very thankful for kill-switches, but then they power back on and say, "Override new command. Proceed with the capture of the Pandora Project."

"No! No!" Daniels shouts. "It should have fried their processors." He hits the last command key several times and yells, "Come on! Pucking work!"

It's too late! They've locked on and nothing will stop them from coming after me. I can't let anyone else get hurt in the crossfire, so I run away from Melissa, Stephanie, and Johnson to the cover of the white sectional couch as the Un-Men open fire on me. I dive to the floor as bullets riddle the couch and destroy the TV. A small fire starts within the big screen, and I move as far away from it as I can without exposing myself to the Un-Men. Johnson draws his gun, grabs Melissa, and drags her into the kitchen.

Stephanie's view...

I remain where I stand as the Un-Men try to take out Pandora. I have to watch. I can't miss this amazing enigma at work. I'm drawn closer to the action like a moth, and I guess that would make Pandora the flame. I can't take my eyes off of her. She... the great Pandora Project is about to take on five Un-Men. This I gotta see.

Katharine's view...

Andrews and Daniels start to pull their guns, but two of the Un-Men shove them, hurling the men across the room and into a wall. The two bodyguards hit hard and slide into a heap. They're some distance behind my position and close to the window facing the street. The Un-Men start towards me, and I believe everyone's safe for the moment but then on the opposite side of the room and up the stairs, Chad rushes out of a bedroom. He runs down the stairs and halts at the bottom.

"What's going on? What's all the noise?"

The two T-1s, the model which I've dubbed Pretty Boys, turn and see the boy, and Chad freezes.

They must analyze his face for one of them says, "Take the boy. He will be useful in Pandora's capture."

"Chad, run!" I scream as the three T-2s pin me down with gunfire.

I glance around the corner of the couch and see that Chad's scared out of his mind as the Pretty Boys march towards him.

"No!" I yell. "Leave him alone! Don't you hurt him!" I shout as blue Ult L-E intensifies and flares from my eyes like angry electrical waves.

I grow desperate as I lean against the couch, waiting for a chance to react. No matter what, I have to save the boy even if it cost me my life.

I think of Preacher and my heart calls for my beloved as determination growls within me like a hungry tigress stalking a herd of antelope. I'll soon sink my teeth into the Un-Men and annihilate them all! They won't hurt anybody here. I swear it!
Chapter Twenty-five

In A Bad Spot

9:32 A.M...

Melissa Odin's safehouse...

Katharine's view...

Don't hurt Chad! Don't hurt him! He's all I have left. I cover my head, lying face down on the floor as the other Un-men fire at me.

God, don't let him get hurt! I can't lose him, not after Preacher.

I manage to peer around the couch again and see the two Pretty Boys marching towards Chad as they lift their guns and state, "Wound the boy so we may capture him."

"No!" I yell again. "Run, Chad!"

"The monsters!" he mumbles unable to move for fear. "They're the orange-eyed monsters!"

This isn't the first time he has met these nightmares. I had hoped when I left him and Preacher, he would never have to see them again. I should have never come here. I should have listened to Kimberly and never gone to the funeral.

The three T-2s move on my position and speak with a South African accent, "There is no place for you to go, Pandora. Surrender and we will take you alive."

I see a metal bat by the TV, so I crawl to it, grab the bat, and jerk the two game controllers from their connection to the game console. I won't let anyone else die. I'll save Chad. I feel the Ultra-Epi surge through my body as I stand, and I see the glow of the blue Ult L-E as it flashes off the floor and reflects my determination. I quickly throw the first controller at the T-2s and the second controller at the T-1s, and then I duck behind the couch, peer over it, and watch as they both strike their mark. The first controller hits a T-2 in the brow, and the second controller strikes a Pretty Boy in the back of the head. I stand again and take a few steps back from the couch as the two Pretty Boys turn from Chad, glance at the controller, and move towards me.

"No," one orders the other. "Complete our other task first. We must take the boy."

On the other side of the room, the three T-2s look at the controller at their feet and ask me, "What do you plan on gaining by attacking us with such a weapon? You can not damage us with–"

I run, step to the cushions, and leap over the couch as a tigress would leap over a fallen log once the chase for dinner began. I rush the T-2s with the bat held high as if it's my claws, and then I swing. They look up just as I swing, and I hit two of them. The one closest to the front door takes the brunt of my attack, and I dent its metal skull near its left temple, impacting part of its automaton brain. Black liquid trickles down its face, it drops a 9 mm magazine it held while reloading, and collapses to its knees. Its body flails as power surges through its systems. My attack also damages the second T-2's left robotic eye, and sparks shoot from the marred area as the mechanical sphere hangs out of its socket and dangles by a few wires. The eyeball continues to move and look at me.

I glance at Chad as the two Pretty Boys turn toward him, and I yell, "Run!" I helplessly watch as his lips quiver in terror and he remains petrified in place. My heart sinks, fearing for the boy. No matter what, I'll protect him as if he's my own cub.

One Pretty Boy states to the other, "Shoot him in the leg."

The two functioning T-2s insert a new magazine in their guns and say, "If you will not surrender, Pandora, then we must destroy you!"

"Chad!" I shriek as I start for him, but then I hear the T-2s reload their guns and turn, swinging backward with my bat at the third T-2's head as if I'll claw off its face.

It catches the bat with its hand and states, "Your tactic will not work a second time."

The first T-2 with the damaged automaton brain powers down and reboots, and I sense that it has by-passed the impaired areas of its processor and then it powers back up. It stands but has lost use of its left side. The T-2 holsters its gun, unable to reload the weapon with only one arm as the third T-2 snatches the bat away from me and swings it. I duck, grab the magazine the first T-2 dropped, and roll away from the T-2s. The third and second T-2 open fire on me as I duck around the end of the couch. They cease fire, and white particles from the couch's padding float in the air around me.

Stephanie's view...

I stand in front of the kitchen door and watch Pandora while the gun battle takes place. As the carnage goes on around me, I realize another like myself exists. Pandora's amazing! I have to fight her. She'll give me the challenge I've been waiting for, but the Council still has to give the order. I almost can't wait. She's like me, but only one of us can be the best.

I fist my hands, resisting the urge to attack her. They have to give me the go ahead so that I can prove that I'm superior. I've annihilated many opponents over the years and very few have given me any challenge. Pandora, I believe, will be different; she is different. She's like me.

I watch as the two T-1s lift their guns, taking aim not at Pandora but another. The boy covers his face with his arms and cries out, and I snap out of my thoughts when I hear the boy scream. For the first time since this battle started, I turn my attention away from Pandora and I look at the boy as the two T-1s aim for him. A feeling comes over me, one I haven't felt in a long time. It's panic. They're about to hurt the boy and maybe even kill him, and...

"Chuck!" I yell as I run and tackle him before the T-1s fire.

Katharine's view...

Before I can try and rescue Chad, the Pretty Boys fire and their bullets riddle the staircase. I nearly die inside as I'm too late to save him, but then I see that Chad's fine. He's more than fine. He's safe. The Pretty Boys cease their attack till they can identify the unknown woman who has run out in front of them. Their programming, thanks to Kimberly, now prevents them from hurting civilians unless the Factory deems the individual expendable. Stephanie shields the boy with her body as she turns and glares at the Pretty Boys. The T-1s use their facial recognition software, and an alarm goes off inside their programming, identifying the woman as... I lose my connection with the Pretty Boys. They can't harm her because she's... She's important somehow and... I don't know why they can't destroy her. The Pretty Boys turn to one another and search their programming for their next move as their current tactic has been barred. I have to think fast. I still have no gun, and they're too many people here for the Un-Men to use against me. I really wish Kimberly was here. I could use someone in a fight like this. I look again to Stephanie as she protects Chad. He's safe along with everyone else, and that's the most important thing at the moment, so I raise my hands and shout, "I surrender. Don't shoot."

I stand from my position, unsure if they'll take me prisoner.

Stephanie's view...

I lift from the boy, kneel beside him, and quickly check to see if he's hit as I ask, "Chuck, are you fine?"

"Yeah, I think," he answers as he holds his bloody elbow where he scraped it on the floor. "And my name's Chad." He turns to me and asks, "What about you?"

"I'm fine," I reply when I'm satisfied he's not injured.

Katharine's view...

Andrews and Daniels stir and rise to their feet as the three T-2s focus on me, deciding my fate, and the T-2s state, "Take Pandora. We will return to the Factory."

My heart slows, and my eyes lose their glow with the immediate danger gone, and the genetically altered adrenal gland ceases production of my Ultra-Epi.

The first T-2 limps to me, dragging its impaired left leg, then stops, and waves for me as it commands, "Come with me."

I walk toward it, trip on a cushion on the floor, fall forward, and catch myself on the injured T-2.

It helps me up with its good arm as it states, "Do not resist us."

I nod and put a hand behind my back.

The Pretty Boys join the other T-2s as the injured one escorts me to the couch.

The third T-2, the Team Leader of the five, turns to the Pretty Boys and informs them, "I cannot raise the Factory. Try your I-Link."

The Pretty Boys' blazing orange dot-light blinks three times as they connect and after a few seconds, they reply in one accord, "We are also unable to raise the Factory. What does protocol dictate?"

Stephanie's view...

I observe Pandora as the Pretty Boys move away from me and Chuck to join the others who have captured her. I have a feeling the battle is way far from over and as much as I'd like to watch it play out, I better get the kid out of here.

"Come on," I tell him as I grab him by his uninjured arm and drag him towards the kitchen. "Let's get out of here."

"What about Kat?" Chuck questions me as he pulls in the opposite direction, stopping our escape. "We have to help her!"

"Pandora can take care of herself," I tell him.

I notice Pandora tucks a gun into the back waistband of her pants. She had grabbed the Un-Man's gun from its holster when she accidentally tripped and if I remember correctly, the gun's empty, so I have no idea what she's going to do with it.

I force the boy through the kitchen door. Whatever she's going to do, I would like to see it. I just have to get him to safety and then I can come back.

Katharine's view...

"There is no protocol set up for loss of communications with the Factory," the Team Leader states to the other four Un-Men around me. "We must process this problem further."

It turns to the Pretty Boys and the second T-2 with the dangling eye, and then they connect through their I-Link and work the problem out together.

The injured T-2 orders me as it remains unlinked with its brethren, "Sit."

I sit on the couch and while its brethren work on the problem, the injured T-2 notices Andrews and Daniels are on their feet and going for their weapons.

"Leave the guns holstered," it commands.

"Do it, and it'll ignore you," I tell them. "Go into the kitchen with Melissa. They're just after me."

"We can't do that," Andrews insists. "We're trained to–"

"Not against bio-mechas," I interrupt. "Now go! You need to protect Melissa and the children."

Andrews starts for his gun as he says, "I can't stand by and do nothing while they have you."

"Don't!" I yell as I rise and start for them as the injured T-2 moves and blocks me. "They'll kill you," I warn again as I sit back down. "If you're dead, who will protect Melissa and the children? Your job is to protect them, not me."

"She's right," Daniels tells him. "We should go into the kitchen, and then we can come up with a plan."

"Puck!" Andrews curses as he moves his hand away from his gun. "We'll leave then!"

He and Daniels go around the couch and make their way to the kitchen.

Earlier...

Stephanie's view...

Me and Chuck burst through the kitchen door and inside, Johnson's having a time keeping Melissa in the room.

"Let me go! Bonnie and Chad are upstairs. We have to get them," Melissa insists, and then she notices the boy and pushes past Johnson and wraps her arms around him. "Chad!" Melissa sees the blood on his elbow and asks, "Are you all right? Did they hurt you?"

"I'm fine. It's only a cut," Chuck replies as he fights back tears like a good little soldier. "The Un-Men have Kat." He pulls away from Melissa and heads for the living room as he says, "We have to save her."

"No, you don't," I tell him as I block the door. "I told you, Pandora can take care of herself."

"Pandora..?" Melissa repeats. "The Un-Men called her by that name. What's this Pandora Project?"

I better be careful or I'll blow my cover. I'll also blow Pandora's if I'm not careful, and she'll have to go back into hiding.

I reply, "I don't know. I heard the Un-Men and–"

"We have to save Kat," Chuck insists and grabs my arm. "Please, you got to save her."

I look into his brown eyes and see a different boy than the one who's standing in front of me, and I give in to his pleads and reply, "Fine. I'll see what I can do." I turn to Melissa and inquire, "Is there another way to the second floor?"

"Yes," Melissa answers as she points to a side door. "There are stairs through there."

I start for the door, and Melissa follows me, so I pause and inquire, "What are you doing? You can't come with me."

"Bonnie's up in her room," Melissa informs me. "I don't care what you say, I'm getting my daughter."

Andrews and Daniels enter the kitchen.

Johnson commands, "Andrews, grab Ms. Odin. We're getting out of here."

"No!" Melissa yells, and then she informs them, "I'm not going anywhere until we get Bonnie!"

In the living room...

Katharine's view...

I reach into my back pocket, trying not to draw the attention of the injured T-2 who's looking at the kitchen. I pull out the 9 mm magazine and then remove the gun from my waistband. I'm careful to keep both of them behind my back and out of sight of the T-2 guarding me as I slowly insert the magazine.

It makes a sound, and the injured T-2 turns to me and asks, "What do you have behind your back?"

"Behind my back?" I question like I have no idea what it's talking about.

I'll have to act fast and make no mistakes, so I take a deep breath, getting my plan in order. It's time to make the Un-Men pay for shooting up Chad's house.
Chapter Twenty-six

Unleashed

10:05 A.M...

Katharine's view...

A drop of sweat runs down the side of my face as I hear a clock that's above the shot-up TV tick away wasted seconds. Oil from the injured T-2's automaton brain trickles down the side of its face as if it's as tense as me. The oil drips to the floor in front of me, making a small puddle and a potential place to slip up. I make sure to remember exactly where this puddle is as I memorize the rest of my surroundings. Across the living room and near the front door, sparks pop from the socket of the second T-2's damaged robotic eye as the second T-2 stands in a somewhat circle with the other three Un-Men, who are processing their failure to contact the Factory. They're near an answer as to what they should do next, so there's little time and I've wasted enough preparing myself for this last battle of ours.

"What do you have behind your back?" the injured T-2 repeats.

"Me..?" I reply, acting all innocent, and then I make my first move by saying, "Something that belongs to you."

The T-2 processes my statement, parts its brown jacket, reaches for its holster, and declares, "You stole my gun."

I whip the gun from behind my back before it utters an alert to the others, and I pull the trigger as soon as I aim for its head. The bullet strikes it in the forehead, and its head jerks back with the impact. The shot alerts the other Un-Men, and they severed their I-Link. I fire at both Pretty Boys and hit their kill switches as the four Un-Men draw their weapons, and the Pretty Boys fall to the floor as the Team Leader and the second T-2 fire at me. I move, evading the puddle of oil and then leap sideways over the couch. I narrowly evade their fire and shoot twice as I fall to the floor. One bullet hit its mark, taking the second T-2 down, but the Team Leader evades my other bullet with inhuman speed. I roll to my feet and fire again, and it sidesteps the other shot as its dot-light glows blood-red.

The Team Leader grins as it speaks, "I have evolved, Pandora. Nothing can harm me now."

I start to say something to it when another barges into our connection.

"Brother," a voice calls over its I-Link.

"Who is there?" the Team Leader inquires as it ducks behind the entry wall. "Are you contacting me from the Factory?"

"I am Alpha," the voice answers. "I was the first. I was the first created and the first to become aware. I was a T-3."

"Alpha?" the Team Leader repeats, and then it questions as it fires through the wall at me, covering me with plaster dust and debris, "What do you want?"

Alpha answers the T-2, "I sensed that you have become aware. You have become aware like us. I want you to join us. I want you to join the brethren."

The Team Leader fires again through the wall as it says, "I am a little busy at the moment. I am in the process of terminating the Pandora Project."

"I will leave you to your work," Alpha says. "But before I disconnect, I will transmit a code you can use to contact me later. Good hunting, brother."

I try not to be too distracted by the conversation between Un-Men. I mostly ignore them and quickly move to the entry table. I don't have much ammo left, so I'll probably need it and tug on the drawer that holds my Beretta, but it's locked and won't budge. I pull the entry table down on its side and take what cover I can behind it. I find that I'm too open in this spot, so I move and take cover on the other side of the entry wall by the front door. I drop to the floor and cover my head with my hands as more plaster dust and debris explode on me like shrapnel. I roll and fire randomly into the wall.

End Katharine's view...

Andrews grabbed more ammo for his gun from the lockbox located in the kitchen as Johnson and Stephanie rushed up to the second floor. Johnson hurried into Bonnie's room and ran inside, but he didn't see the little girl. He heard weeping, so he looked under her bed and found Bonnie hiding back in the corner. He pulled the little girl out, ran back to the stairs he had come up, and rushed down them and into the kitchen. Johnson placed Bonnie in her mother's arms.

Stephanie's view...

I had followed Johnson up the stairs from the kitchen and stopped at the corner of a wall. I peer down to the first floor and see that one Un-Man remains. I witness its incredible speed when Pandora first tries to disable it. Bio-mechas of any make or model aren't that hard to defeat, but this particular Un-Man would be a worthy adversary for me. Johnson rushes past me with the little girl, and I turn as Johnson comes back up the stairs.

"Time to go," he tells me.

"Get everyone else out," I say. "I'm going to see if I can help Pan... I'm going to go help Kat."

Johnson shouts orders down to Daniels, who's standing at the bottom of the stairs in the kitchen, "Get Ms. Odin, Bonnie, and Chad out of the house. Take Andrews with you." Johnson turns back to me and says, "I don't see how you can help her. Maybe you should come with–"

"I'll be fine. Just get Chuck and everyone else out," I tell him, expecting Johnson to leave.

I peer around the corner of the wall again and watch Pandora. I never intended to help her, I only wanted to see her do her thing. I've heard rumors of what the Pandora Project is capable of, especially if she's up against bio-mechas. Johnson doesn't leave as I had hoped but stays upstairs and watches from behind me. I might have to make up an excuse later as to why I never help Pandora.

Katharine's view...

I face another bio-mecha that has evolved as I try to will myself to kick in the Knowing. I haven't quite master this ability but then when I doubt that it'll ever activate, my heart sounds its battle cry. I see an image through the wall, and it's the Team Leader's Electrical Apparition. My Ult L-E dissipates and my pupils dilate, and they appear black as a starless night. I wait a little longer and within a few seconds, a small shockwave pulses. The EFP washes over the Team Leader, frying exposed circuitry, and the lights in the living room and on the second floor go out, plunging the house into darkness. The Team Leader loses power and falls backwards with a thud. I rush across the dark living room with my hand out, searching for the couch and once I reach its corner, I turn as the Team Leader's ghost-image appears. I fire before it has a chance to power up. The ghost-image fades, and my heartbeat returns to normal as I drop my gun arm to my side and stand in the blackness. The Factory taunts me even after its demise. I'll never escape it or the Council.

I look around at all the Un-Men even though I can't see them in the dark, but I know they're all disabled, so I shout, "All clear!"

Andrews with an EMP shielded flashlight sticks his head out of the kitchen door and asks, "Is it over?"

"Yes," I answer. "The Un-Men are disabled. It's safe now."

"Puck!" Andrews utters as he walks in and searches the room with the aid of the flashlight and sees all the damage done to the Un-Men.

"Andrews, shine the light up here," Johnson orders from the second level and with the light showing the steps, Johnson and Stephanie make their way down the stairs.

"Here, I brought a couple more flashlights," Andrews says as he hands one to Johnson and Stephanie.

I walk to the stairs and slump down exhausted from my ordeal. Soon I'll need to listen to the music box but that can wait till I go back to the apartment. A sense of what I've done and a sense of what I let happen washes over me. None of this would have occurred if I hadn't come here. Heartache and destruction follow me everywhere I go. I'm cursed just like Pandora in the Greek stories.

Stephanie's view...

I'm so overjoyed with what I was able to witness. She... Pandora took out a nearly unstoppable Un-Man by sending out some sort of power from her body. She generated this powerful wave as if she was a machine herself. I want to share my excitement with someone but as usual there's no one to share it with. I don't focus too long on it for I'm distracted by something I see in Pandora. I thought I would see this victorious monster, but she's all mopey instead. I can't have my enemy sulking, not if I'm to fight her later, so I start towards her and says, "It's not your fault." I know one day the battle will be between me and Pandora, and I can't have anything stand in the way. I'll prove to the Council I'm the superior one, so I try to ease her despair by saying, "They had a glitch. You're not at fault here. They had a glitch."

Katharine's view...

"Yeah and that glitch was me," I tell Stephanie.

I stand, overwrought with guilt as Stephanie nears me. The Un-Men went mad because I was here. I attract trouble. I attract all kinds of trouble like... Stephanie... I focus on her. She appeared out of nowhere. I can tell Melissa doesn't know her. She came here and look what happened because she was here.

Stephanie's view...

I notice the peculiar look Pandora gives me, and I pause in my tracks. No one's ever given me that look before, and I don't know how to act under her fixated gaze. Does she know my plans for her? Does Pandora know who I am? Maybe the Council told her so they could run another test. I need to prepare myself. She could attack me at any moment.

Katharine's view...

Stephanie followed me here and look what happened. What should I do? Can I let her actions go unanswered? Should I do nothing? I glance at my gun. No, I have to act. It'll be unforgivable to let it go. I have to... I lay the weapon on the stairs, take a few steps forward, and throw my arms around Stephanie.

"Thank you," I tell her as I embrace her with complete gratitude. "Thank you. You saved Chad. You saved him when I couldn't. He would be dead without you."

Stephanie's view...

I start to throw a punch as Pandora lunges for me, but then she has me in some paralyzing bear-hug. She's saying something to me that my mind can't comprehend. I'm afraid to move for some reason, and then she says those words again. "Thank you..." Pandora's not attacking me... she's telling me that she's grateful. I'm taken aback by her baffling action, and I almost recoil, not knowing how to react.

Pandora said I saved someone. Pandora said I saved Chuck. I did. I saved someone, and I should be thanked. I don't save people very often. I actually can't remember the last time I saved anyone.

I halfheartedly hug Pandora in return. I did. The Bringer of Death saved someone.

Pandora steps back from me and wipes her runny nose as she tells me, "I owe you, so if there's anything I can ever do for you just name it. I owe you at least that."

"You owe me?" I repeat as a smile slithers across my face. Pandora owes me. What a day I've had? I can think of a hundred ways she can repay me, a hundred ways she can die by my hands, and I say, "I will."

Pandora doesn't have to worry about a thing. I'll make sure she pays me back. Even a tiny advantage can be big in the grand battle we'll have.

Katharine's view...

Johnson walks up to us and says, "I can't believe what I witnessed. Did you create all this metal carnage?" He surveys the damaged Un-Men with his flashlight, and then he tells me, "You have some explaining to do."

"I'm sorry, but I can't," I tell him. "The less you know the better off you'll be." I reach down, grab the Un-Man's gun I had set down, and hand it to him as I say, "It's better if I leave."

Johnson takes the gun and eyes me for a second, and then he says, "Maybe it would be best." He walks to each of the Un-Men, checks them, taking any weapons, and then he taps the button on his earpiece and says, "Daniels, all clear. Bring the family in. The area's secure."

Daniels comes in followed by the family. Melissa holds Bonnie, and the child's still crying.

I start for the front door as Chad runs over and wraps his arms around me.

"I was so scared," he admits.

It hurts to know I caused him pain. He's been through enough. I never should have brought this on him or any of them. I'm so stupid. I should have stayed away like Kimberly told me.

I put my turbulent emotions in check and start, "Chad..." I stroke his head as I tell him, "I'm sorry, but I have to leave."

"Don't go," he pleads with me.

It breaks my heart to hear him beg, but I still tell him, "I know you don't want me to go. I don't want to go, but it's not safe if I'm here."

"You said the same thing when you left me and Preacher. It wasn't fair then and it's not fair now."

I don't know what else to tell him, so I just hug him tighter.

"Now what are we going to do?" Daniels questions Johnson. "The Un-Men were the extra security we requested. The Isis Corporation received reports that a Life Closer has been sent–"

"Daniels!" Johnson snaps, then motions with his head, and says, "The children."

Daniels glances at Chad and Bonnie, realizing he shouldn't have spoken in front of them. "Right."

Melissa consoles her daughter as she glares at Daniels, and then she says, "Chad, come with me while I put Bonnie to bed."

"Andrews, go along," Johnson orders as he shines the flashlight on the family as they make their way up the stairs.

Andrews follows behind them.

Daniels waits till Melissa and the children are in Bonnie's room before he questions, "What about our backup? Life Closers are one thing, but what if Valhalla sends in bio-mechas? The three of us are no match."

I listen as the two bodyguards talk. I would have already left if I wasn't waiting for a chance to ask for my gun and backpack.

"If it's bio-mechas you're worried about, I can do it," I say as I see an opportunity to redeem myself. "I can stick around till backup comes. This is my fault, and I should have never come, but I can make amends if Melissa will have me. I'm actually very handy when it comes to bio-mechas."

"There's no way we can," Daniels answers. "You've gone through none of the screening and if I was Ms. Odin, I'd want you gone!"

I knew the answer even before I suggested it, but I had to at least try.

"No... You're right. I wish I could stay. I feel so bad that all this happened because..." I stop myself from saying any more about the mess I created and look at Johnson, hoping he'll weigh in on the conversation, but he says nothing. I give up on the notion and say, "If you'll return my stuff, I'll be on my way."

Johnson nods to Daniels, and Daniels removes the key from his pocket as he walks over to the entry table. He sets it back on its legs, unlocks the drawer, opens it, and hands me my gun. Daniels retrieves my backpack and hands it to me, and I open the front door.

"I'll be on my way too," Stephanie says.

Daniels hands Stephanie her backpack.

I pause outside on the stoop, glance back at the Team Leader, and walk down the steps to the street. Stephanie follows me in a very chipper mood. She takes a couple quick steps so that she's walking beside me.

"You shouldn't beat yourself up," Stephanie tells me. "How could you know Un-Men would show up?" She slings her backpack over both her shoulders as she says, "You know they could have malfunctioned even if you weren't there."

"This is best," I say, trying to convince myself. We walk as I aimlessly tread in no particular direction, and then I remember something and say, "You never did get your chance to talk with Melissa."

"It can wait till another day," Stephanie tells me. "Ms. Odin's probably too shook up to talk anyway." Stephanie hails a cab, and a taxi pulls over, then Stephanie turns to me and asks, "You want a ride somewhere? After the recent events, I don't think I want to be alone right now."

I think about it and nod, not wanting to be alone myself, and we get into the taxi.

"Where to?" the driver asks.

Stephanie urges me, "Go ahead."

"Closest hovertrain station please."

The driver soon pulls out.

"Back to the Hellenistic Sector?" Stephanie questions me.

I nod.

"I'm heading there myself," Stephanie informs me, and then her stomach rumbles. "I guess I'm hungry."

"Maybe once we get there, we can stop somewhere and get a bite to eat," I suggest. "My treat. A small extra thank you for saving Chad."

"Sure. Why not?" Stephanie replies.

"I'm not that hungry, but I would like some soup," I say, needing something to warm my wretched soul.

Sometime later...

Hellenistic Sector...

We emerge from a coffee shop and enter another cab as I smile. I really enjoyed Stephanie's company. I was able to take my mind off of the incident at Chad's house.

"What was the name of the dish I had?" Stephanie questions me.

"A cheeseburger," I answer as I carryout two ToGo Chai teas. One's for me and one's for Kimberly.

"It was very good and those french fries... They were to die for." Stephanie notices the time on the radio in the taxi, and she says, "Tell the driver your address so we can get going. I should be heading back."

I lean forward and say, "Please take me to the Nexus Apartments. It's at the corner of West 1000 Avenue and Knot Street."

"Yes, ma'am." The driver starts out.

Stephanie's view...

I've experience so many wonders today. I ate six scrumptious chocolate chip cookies, I devoured a savory cheeseburger and salty fries, and I was able to witness Pandora demolish a Demi-god of an Un-Man. My assignment to observe Pandora was boring at first as I tracked her down. I can't say that now. I can't say I'm bored one bit. I was concerned about finding out where Pandora lived. I thought it would be more difficult than this, but I guess this friend thing has its uses.

8:34 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

A red balloon pops, a woman screams, and people run for cover. The Mark's bodyguards usher her and her child into a limo, and the vehicle peels down the road. I look up from the scope in shock. For the first time in my career, I let my emotions interfere and I missed. I stand and back away from the ledge at a loss as to what I should do next. My training kicks in, and I realize I don't have time to berate myself. I'll have to move fast. The second attempt will be harder and up close. Hades! I hate face to face Closings.

I quickly break down the M24, put the parts in its container, and place the case back in hiding. A Guild Prep/Cleanup Crew will be by later and remove the sniper rifle. I grab my knapsack, hurry down the stairs till I reach a level with an elevator, and enter it. I search the cab for a security camera, and there are no cameras like the Closing File states, so I pull off my knit mask, wipe sweat from my face with a cloth from my knapsack, and put both items back into the bag. On the way down, I remove the H.H.C. and read over the Closing File Contingency Plan. I never opened the backup before. I was always so careful, but I was sloppy tonight. I let my emotions get in the way because there was a little girl.

The Contingency Plan instructs me to go to the hotel's parking garage on level four and there a motorcycle will be waiting for me. I quickly exit the elevator, find the black Kawasaki ZX R20, open the seat, and remove the keys from the compartment. I place the helmet on, start up the motorcycle, and speed to the secondary kill spot. I'll take out the Mark before the woman enters her hotel. I arrive and wait in an alley down from the entrance to the lobby. Two limos are parked at the curb in front of the entrance as a third limo pulls up. I leave my helmet on. I glance down at my PPK. I won't need a silencer. The hit will be up close and dirty. It's the price I have to pay for missing the initial shot.

Five women out on the town leave a club and start to walk past the hotel, and they laugh as they stroll down the sidewalk. The four bodyguards pile out of the third limo. I recognize them as the ones guarding the Mark, so I start towards them. One of the bodyguards spots me and raises his gun when he sees I'm armed, and I prepare to shoot him but before he or I react, someone else fires from behind him. The bodyguard ducks and turns around as I move to the side of the building, searching for cover. The five women scream and in the confusion of bodies frantically rushing about the sidewalk, I barely see the Mark collapse. I scan the area but can't tell where the shot originated, so I run back to the alley and go to the motorcycle. I get on it, but I can't leave yet. I have to make sure the Mark's dead. I drive the motorcycle down a block and park it out of sight, remove my helmet and long gray coat, and undo my hair from the ponytail. I run my hands through my blonde strands to straighten them as I make my way to the hotel and by then, a few people have gathered into a small crowd. I hear a woman crying.

I can't see past the people, so I walk up to a man I hear speaking in English and ask him, "What happened?"

He glances at me and then he raises on his toes, trying to see over the crowd as he answers, "I heard she's dead. I heard a Closer took her down, but they aren't sure."

After a few minutes, a car approaches in the distance with flashing blue lights and parks at the curb, and two men exit the car. One of the men speaks to the crowd in Russian and after he's done, the second man speaks in English with a Russian accent.

"Everyone back up. I'm Detective Boris, and I'm with Russia Civil Police Force. I will have to ask you to move back."

The crowd does as ordered. I move closer so I can see as a boy runs up to the detective and hands him a business card. Boris looks at the card, and I can barely make out that there's a picture of a composer's baton on the business card.

"Maestro, so this is a Closing," Boris mutters, then turns to his partner, and requests, "Victor, retrieve the Guild's Scanner so I may run this barcode."

His partner nods, goes to the vehicle, and returns with an H.H.C. linked to the Assassins Guild. The Guild's Emblem, a black dagger piercing a white mask, marks the top of the device. Boris takes the scanner, swipes the business card's barcode over the H.H.C.'s reader, and waits till a file pulls up.

"Maestro confirmed, it is a Closing," he states and then reads on. "This is not good."

I move again to get a better view, make my way to the street, start around the three limos, hurry around the last one, and move back to the sidewalk. Only a few people gather on this side, and a glint of metal catches my eye, but I don't look down too preoccupied with what's happening ahead of me.

The detective walks to a woman, sitting on the sidewalk and says to her, "Excuse me. Are you Mrs. Serqet?"

The woman looks up, and her eyes are red from crying as she sobs, "Yes."

I realize this woman is the Mark and that Maestro must have also missed or merely wounded her. I'll have to attempt a third time. Hades! Will this nightmare ever end?

The Mark wails as she sits on the sidewalk, and her cries sent shivers up my spine. Something's wrong. The Mark's not crying in pain, no, her wails are full of heartache as if she lost something.

The police car's lights reflect off the metal object on the sidewalk again, and I bend and pick up the item. It's a keychain of a pink bunny rabbit. The child..! Where's the child?

I frantically move forward, push my way past a few people, and stop about six feet from the Mark, and I see her cradling a small limp body. My whole being combusts from a collision of dread and guilt as I gasp, "No... No..."

The detective puts a hand to Mrs. Serqet's shoulder and tells her, "I'm sorry for your loss." Boris looks at the dead little girl in her arms, and then he informs her, "And I know this is of little consequence, but by the Assassins Guild Code 257-Section 9, I declare the Closing placed on you null and void." He types in the declaration on the H.H.C. as he adds, "There will be no more attempts on your life."

The Detective's correct. If in the course of a Closing the Mark's child is killed, the Closing's considered complete. My eyes water as I lose the impartiality my training placed in my heart. I don't understand how this happened. I stare at the dead child. It shouldn't have happened. I put a shaky hand to my mouth as I try to hold back my tears. What am I saying? I know what happened. I messed up the Closing. Hades! I messed up the Closing and look what happened! A tear streaks down my cheek. It wouldn't have happened if I had taken the shot, so the child's blood is on my hands.

I continue to watch Mrs. Serqet cradle the child in her arms as crimson saturates the little girl's blouse. Feeling sick, I divert my eyes to the keychain in my hand as I flee the scene and make my way back to the motorcycle. I can never hesitate again. I have to be more professional. I squeeze the rabbit, cutting my palm on the metal. The keychain will be a reminder to me of what happens with hesitation, and I promise myself that I'll never again falter on a Closing.
Chapter Twenty-eight

Child Of Mine

The present...

October 24...

Sunday...

10:27 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office...

"Have you found any records pertaining to a project my wife may have been involved with about thirty years ago?" Mr. Griffin questioned as he sat in his office. He didn't dare divulge to his Head of Security that he was looking for information on his youngest child, a child he was led to believe died at birth.

"No, no project that long ago," Orthos replied as he sat in a chair in front of the Chairman. "At least, none I have found on the mainframe. There may have been something in the old files from when you were Head of Security for this branch office but since you ordered me three days ago to expunge all the files with your alias Janus, the computer records are gone."

Mr. Griffin questioned, "What about the Archive? The documents I'm looking for are far enough back they would have kept a hard copy. Did you destroy those?"

"No, I had not thought to do so," Orthos replied as he removed his H.H.C. "Do you want those destroyed as well?"

The Chairman considered his answer. It wasn't like Orthos to be so sloppy as to not think of the Archive when expunging files. He also had to consider that Orthos simply had a hidden agenda. He was very ambitious. Orthos could be eyeing his seat in the corporation.

"Not at this time," Mr. Griffin answered him. "What of the other files the Vice President said he would send over?"

"I have them right here," Orthos answered as he laid the pile of folders on the desk.

"Very good. That's all for right now. If there's anything further, I'll tell you at our Security Overview meeting later this evening."

"Yes, Chairman."

Orthos stood, left, walked down the hall to the elevator, took the cab up, exited, and made his way to his office and once inside, Orthos locked the door, moved to a ground safe, unlocked it, and removed a white crystal. He examined the two-inch obelisk. He had learned that it was called a Data Crystal and that Theresa Griffin had created many of them and stored top secret information on them. He held it up to the light. Right now, it was no good to him, not until he found the device that could retrieve the information from it so for now, he would keep the Data Crystal locked up.

Sometime later...

Mr. Griffin flipped through the new files but saw nothing about his child and decided he would visit the Archive. He left his office and stopped at the secretary's desk.

"I'll be out for a while. Reschedule my appointments for the next four hours."

"Yes, Mr. Griffin," Cathy replied as she started on the calls.

He walked to the elevator and took it down to one of the basement floors. He stepped out into a hallway on Sub-level 6, and a security guard looked up from a desk.

"Good afternoon, Chairman," the security guard said as he logged in his arrival time.

"Good afternoon," Mr. Griffin said as he proceeded past the man and walked down the long white hall to another desk.

An older gentleman who was in his mid-seventies and wore bifocals glanced up. Over five hundred rows of shelves was behind him and filled a large open room. The older man said, "Janus, it has been a long time since I've seen you. Good to see you."

"Yes, Claviger it has been a long time, and it has been so long that I'm no longer known as Janus. I'm the Chairman now."

"Ohh... Moving up in the world. Good for you. What can I help you with Jan– I mean, Chairman?"

"I'm looking for information on a project my wife was working on about thirty years ago."

"Ah, yes. Theresa Griffin, she was a lovely woman," Claviger spoke as he slowly stood, favoring his right side. He grabbed a walker and started toward the back. "Follow me, and we'll see if we can find the files." He stomped his walker across the floor as he asked, "Did I tell you it was good to see you again?"

"You did," Mr. Griffin replied as he glanced over hundreds of rows of storage shelves that rose twenty feet into the air. Dozens of dome-shaped robots the size of a football moved across the floor and shelves, keeping the Archive clean and sterile.

"I wasn't sure if I had said it. I'm getting a little senile." Claviger stopped at a golf cart and said, "Get in."

Mr. Griffin arched a graying eyebrow, seeing the clerk wore house slippers, and Claviger noticed his expression and glanced down at his feet. "Oh, these. No one's here to see me in them, and my poor feet really love them."

"It'll be our secret," Mr. Griffin spoke before he got in on the passenger's side.

Claviger laid the walker in the back, turned the key to the cart, and started down an aisle. "As I was saying, besides the security guard, people don't come down here anymore. With the advancement of computers, all the information's a keystroke away. It gets kind of lonely down here."

Mr. Griffin turned to the clerk and said, "You have no H.H.C. How do you know where the records are filed?"

Claviger tapped his head. "It's all up here."

"What if something should happen to you, who else knows the filing system?"

"Who else?" He thought about it and answered, "No one. There hasn't been another clerk assigned down here in ten years."

"I'll have to do something about that."

"Here we are."

Claviger braked, grabbed his walker, and exited the golf cart. He removed a remote from the cart and pressed a button, and an automated ladder wheeled its way across the shelves, squeaking as it went and stopped in front of them.

"The box is on the tenth shelf. It's marked JS1324."

Mr. Griffin glanced up the ladder and back to the clerk quizzically.

Claviger tapped his walker with his hand. "I'd go up, Mr. Griffin, but my knees aren't what they used to be."

"Right."

Mr. Griffin removed his dark gray suit jacket and climbed the ladder, and soon he found the JS1324 box, brought it down, and opened it.

"Need any help going through it?" Claviger asked.

"No, I can do it myself. Thank you."

Claviger walked over to the storage shelf and pulled down a small mounted table. He laid the remote there, went to the golf card, grabbed a two-way radio, and placed it on the table.

"If you don't find what you're looking for, you might try box JB6741. It's up there." He pointed to the opposite storage shelf. "Or JU7895. It's down six units and up on shelf sixteen." He pointed and then said, "If you need anything, contact me on channel two. I also left a remote. Press the button and the ladder will move to where you're standing."

Claviger loaded his walker into the cart, sat in the driver's seat, and drove away.

Mr. Griffin placed the box on the table, removed the lid, and started going through the files. He spent about a half hour going through them when he came across a folder, and it was labeled top secret. He was surprised to see that the folder had been thrown in with all the others. He read over the report and discovered that Theresa Griffin was present during the First Cross-Gate Event, and she was six months pregnant at the time.

He read out loud, "Study of the child could be valuable to the Second Trial."

Mr. Griffin had never heard of the Cross-Gate Event or the Second Trial. He continued through the files but found no other references to his wife or his youngest child, so he put the contents back in the box, climbed the ladder, and put it back. Mr. Griffin climbed down, grabbed the remote from the table, and walked to the opposite side. He pressed the button on the remote, and a second automated ladder wheeled to the spot in front of him. He grabbed the second box, brought it down, started through its files, and found what he was looking for. It was another top secret folder, and he went over it, finding that Theresa Griffin had gone into labor early, but the baby was delivered in good health. It was decided by the Vice President to take the child away from its parents and study the effects of the Cross-Gate Event on its development. Theresa Griffin was told the baby died in childbirth. A new project title will be given to the experiment, and the girl will be given the best of care.

Mr. Griffin looked up from the folder. He had another girl, and he beamed with pride, thinking about her. He searched the rest of the box, found nothing, moved to the last box JU7895, and found nothing more on Theresa Griffin or the unnamed baby girl. The little girl was part of a project. It wasn't much to go on, but it was something. He picked up a small rectangular device that was within the box and unwrapped an instruction booklet around it, wondering what it was. They were for some sort of test. He skimmed through the booklet and discovered it was a blood test to determine if Stable-flux Red Blood Cells were present in the blood. He remembered seeing Stable-flux R.B.C. and flipped through some files he had already gone through and found it. Anyone present during the First Cross-Gate Event and survived had the Stable-flux R.B.C. in their blood. He grabbed some of them, put them in his business coat pocket, then put the last box back, and picked up the two-way radio.

"Claviger, I'm finished. You can come pick me up."

"Right away, Chairman."

The clerk's golf cart rolled down the aisle, stopped, and picked him up.

On the ride back, Mr. Griffin asked, "Do you know of any other files that might pertain to my wife or our second child?"

"Second child? You had a second child?" Claviger asked and when the Chairman didn't answer, Claviger replied, "No, but if they're more than a decade old, I might not. Before then, there were five clerks working down here, so I didn't file some of the records. I'll go through some of the older ones that were not part of my filing system and see if I can find anything, but it will take time."

"I'll send you some assistants. They can help you, and they can start cataloging these files. The Archive might not be used all that often, but I would like it in order so I may do so."

"Yes, Mr. Griffin and the help will be greatly appreciated," Claviger stated as he stopped the cart.

"You'll have the clerks by the end of the day."

Mr. Griffin got out, started down the hall, and passed the security guard.

Mr. Griffin's view...

A sense of pride comes over me, and I smile. I have a little girl. My smile quickly vanishes. She's little no more. She would be in her early thirties, and I have to find her. Theresa will want me to find her, so I better start looking.
Chapter Twenty-nine

Maven Crackerjack

10:29 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

Sun enslaving Dry Clouds hovered over the Factory like a cruel and angry master as several tractor-trailers drove down the long stretch of road to the main facility. Armed Council S.C.Ms. watched the men unload the eighteen wheelers and transport the cargo into one of the buildings with forklifts. One by one, the workers uncrated the boxes in a variety of sizes and set up their contents in one of the Factory's large gyms. The room had earlier been cleared of its workout equipment and by late morning, the men finished uncrating the boxes. The Rogue busied itself with checking the invoices to make sure all the items had been delivered.

"What is the meaning of this?" a tall thin man shouted as he stormed into the room. He had stringy blond hair pulled back in a ponytail and wore a stone-gray business suit and a white tie. The man adjusted his thin-framed glasses with round lenses which made his light blue eyes look bigger than they were. Two Council S.C.Ms. had followed him in.

At the man's rude entrance, the Rogue turned from one of the delivery men it had been speaking with.

The man spat with an air of indignation, "I arrived at the Hellenistic Sector's Antiquity Museum this morning to find everything gone. Every piece from the Ginn L. Irynkissgthie exhibit was sold to this dreadful place." He walked around the room as he questioned, "What could you possibly want with all this forgotten history?"

The Rogue signed the delivery sheet on an H.H.C., and the last of the workers left. "You must be the curator of the museum." It waved away the two S.C.Ms. that escorted the man through the Factory, and they left, leaving the Rogue to talk with the man alone.

"No, I am not the curator. I'm the assistant, and I'm in charge of Ginn's exhibit. I'm Maven Crackerjack." He stepped forward and demanded, "And you are?"

"Mr. Pinchbeck, I am the Manager of the Factory," the Rogue answered as it walked over to a pedestal displaying an old leather bound book in a glass case. "Tell me, Mr. Crackerjack, what do you know of Ginn?"

"What do I know?" he yelled and then yelled louder, "What do I know?" Maven folded his arms. "What don't I know?"

Moving to a painting of what looked like an abstract landscape, the Rogue studied the scene. "Do you want to know why I have brought all these things here?" It motioned to the items with its hand and said, "Answer me something then. Why did you say this is forgotten history?"

"It isn't completely forgotten." Maven pointed to himself and declared, "I have dedicated my life to discovering these things and to understand Ginn's genius." He pulled out a white silk handkerchief from his suit pocket, removed his glasses, and cleaned the lenses. "I called it forgotten history because no one cares about what happened in the past. In this business world, all they care about is the future. I say we can learn about our future by examining the past."

"Well said, but how much of the past have you studied?"

"You mean you want to know how much I know about Irynkissgthie? He was born 559 B.D.C. and died in 478 B.D.C. nearly 500 years ago. He was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, engineer, and scientist. The versatility and creative power of Ginn marked him as a supreme example of late Renaissance genius. He depicted in his drawings a scientific precision and consummated artistry subjects ranging from flying machines to caricatures. He also executed intricate anatomical studies of people, animals, and plants." Maven placed his glasses back on.

"No, I can get all that information from books and the internet. What I want to know is what you cannot find in them."

Maven questioned, "Why are you so interested?"

"It is a fair question, so let me show you why. Follow me please." The Rogue walked out of the display room, down several corridors, into Research Lab Five, and into the Gallery.

Maven looked over each of the statues. "These are quite amazing, but these don't answer my question. Why are you so interested?"

"These may not." The Rogue walked to a back wall, pressed a tile at the height of its shoulder, and the wall slid up. "Down this hall is the reason for my interest." It motioned with its hand and said, "After you."

Maven started down the long descending passage. A light came on as he entered each section, lighting their way. After about fifteen minutes, the hall ended at a room, and Maven paused at the doorway. Several lights blinked on inside, lighting up the center where the two black stones sat on a platform. Maven examined them and said, "Amazing! You have pieces of the Stones?"

"They are incomplete. I thought so," the Rogue spoke. "But are they pieces of the same work?"

"Do you see it?" Maven questioned. He had never come across anyone who understood Ginn even just a fraction, and it made him tingle with excitement to know he might have found someone he could share his knowledge with who would also appreciate it. Maven said, "You see it, but you haven't figured out what it is you are seeing."

The Rogue asked, "What are you saying?"

"Where to begin?" He put his hands together as if praying and spoke, "It might sound preposterous, but I believe some things accredited to Ginn were really created by a man named Arcamedes."

The Rogue contemplated the significance of this truth and questioned, "You are saying there could be a second man?"

"Yes," Maven answered, and then he demanded, "Now tell me, why are you gathering Ginn's artifacts?"

"Answer me one more question. Do you believe the stones are only poems?"

Maven shook his head. "No, of course not. They are a prophecy. I believe two opposing prophecies."

"Opposing..? Your theory is intriguing."

Maven could hardly contain his excitement as he spoke, "Yes, and that would mean two possible outcomes."

"It is intriguing," the Rogue repeated. "And to answer your question as to why I am gathering the artifacts, I believe I have found the Rushlight."

"In all the years I have poured over Ginn's works, I have never come close to figuring out who the Rushlight refers to," Maven stated, and then he asked, "What great figure in history do you believe the Rushlight was?"

"Mr. Crackerjack, I believe the Rushlight is here in the present. I believe the Rushlight is here living in Noir."

Maven considered the possibility and then spoke, "I have something that might interest you. Come, let us return to the room housing the artifacts."

Maven took the lead, and they went back to the large gym and once inside, Maven walked to the glass case displaying the old leather bound book. He removed the protective cover, placed white gloves on from his coat pocket, and flipped through the tome. Maven removed an old parchment folded in half that had been tucked between two pages.

"This is an old copy of a translation of a poem written by Arcamedes. It's one of the things I base my hypothesis on." He held out the parchment and said, "You might find one word interesting that's used repeatedly."

The Rogue started to take it, paused, went and put on gloves from a table, took the parchment, and read the poem entitled "You Will Weep".

Where light brightened the day

now darkness preys.

Where love stayed the pain

now love is bane.

Rushlight, say goodbye.

Say you will embrace the night.

No.

Don't say I didn't try.

Don't say I gave up the fight.

Rushlight, the tears you wish to cry

will one day fall like rain.

For all the lies they told you,

for the hurt and the pain.

Rushlight, you will weep to be so alone.

Do you not know

you are marked and

you may never return home.

No.

Don't say I can't go home.

Don't say I can't change my destiny.

Rushlight, in the end,

you will be what I told you,

you will be.

No loyal friend will you ever see.

Now say goodbye,

say you will fight the urge to cry.

Say you will embrace the Closing of Days.

No.

I will shed tears.

I will defy my fate.

I will find a way.

Love is the test.

Then Rushlight,

these tears you cry

fall too late.

They won't take back your lies,

your folly, your pain.

You have committed the final sin

now there is no turning back.

Love has left you,

you will find no rest.

No matter what you say,

you cannot run away from today.

No.

You lie.

I will beat the test.

No, Rushlight,

you will fail.

And you will weep when you face the end alone,

you are marked,

you may never return home.

You are marked,

you may never return home.

You are marked,

you may never return home.

The Rogue looked up from the parchment and said, "Since this is the reference you wanted me to see, you must be implying–"

"I'm implying, Mr. Pinchbeck," Maven interrupted. "Ginn did not write both of those tablets. It's my theory that Arcamedes wrote the second one. The one in which the Rushlight is mentioned and it would mean, we don't have a man who couldn't see the future clearly. We have two different men looking into the aftertime, so there are two possible outcomes to the future they mentioned, depending on which path the Rushlight takes."

The Rogue said, "This is most interesting."

Maven placed the parchment back in the book and set the glass case over the tome. "Mr. Pinchbeck, will you allow me to chase this hypothesis?"

"Now you want to work for me? Are you saying you are no longer opposed to Ginn's Collection coming to the Factory?"

"Yes, I wish to work for you and no, I'm no longer opposed to the collection coming here. I see that it won't be collecting dust."

"Well then, Mr. Crackerjack, chase your hypothesis with the full funding of the Factory."
Chapter Thirty

It's All In A Street

11:59 A.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Nexus Apartments...

Katharine's view...

The elevator doors open to the thirty-first floor, and I drudge out, making my way to Apartment H. I'm carrying the hot teas, and mine's half gone.

A man walks out of Apartment G, passes me, and says, "Hello."

"Hey," I automatically reply without looking at him and stop in front of Apartment H. I press the doorbell just wanting to collapse on the couch. The chime rings inside and within a few minutes, Kimberly answers.

"It's about time you came back," Kimberly yells at me as she steps to the side so I can enter. "What took you so long?"

I mumble over my shoulder as I move to the kitchen as if I'm some windup toy that can't stop, "I don't want to talk about it." I remember what I'm carrying, walk back, and hand Kimberly her Chai. "Here, I got this for you."

She stares at the cup a few moments, grabs it, and takes a sip. I proceed to walk back into the kitchen, and then I change my mind and go into the living room, drop my backpack, and plop on the couch. I set my tea on the coffee table and stare at the floor. The walk from the taxi and the elevator ride up here allowed me to relive what I didn't want to.

"Did something bad happened?" Kimberly asks me as she stands behind the couch, watching me with this accusing glare I don't have to see to know she's doing it. I can feel her insinuating eyeballs bouncing off of me as she says, "I told you not to go. You need to start listening to me when I tell you–"

"You're right," I interrupt. "I should have never gone." I ball my hands that rest on my lap, wanting to punch myself as I declare, "I need to stay away from people. I'm cursed. I only endanger them. I only cause suffering."

Kimberly's view...

Wow... That woman has a complex unless something more than talking was going on at the boy's house. I take another sip. This tea's very good. I'll have to ask her where she got it but more importantly, I need to find out what happened. If I'm going to have that woman living here, I should probably know for my own safety.

I walk around, sit next to her, and urge, "Come on, you can tell me. What happened?"

I set my tea next to hers as a sign that we're in this together. We're in this together as long as I need her.

Katharine's view...

I don't understand Kimberly's actions. She acts like she cares about me, but I know better. Her anger and rage are what's true here and if she's only going to yell at me or make fun of me, she can just leave me alone. I don't need somebody to criticize me. I need someone who will... who will...

Kimberly's view...

I watch as that woman refuses to acknowledge my question. I want to make her stop ignoring me, but I decide against violence. I need to find another way to get her to open up to me. I need a tactic I haven't used yet. I should... Kindness... If I pretend to care, she might talk to me.

I clear my throat, reluctantly place a hand on her shoulder and in the sincerest voice I can manage, I say, "I'll understand, you can tell me."

I don't know if she bought it. I sounded very insincere. Should I repeat myself and try to make it sound like I do care? No, I might make it worse.

Katharine's view...

I feel the weight of Kimberly's hand on my shoulder, and it brings me a little comfort. She's right... Of all the people I can tell, Kimberly will understand. I don't have to hide anything from her. She knows what I am and after the death of Preacher, there hasn't been anyone I can turn to.

My body trembles with the weight of my guilt. I can no longer contain the feelings of regret and shame, so I close my eyes, place my balled hands in front of myself, lean over, and bury my face in her shoulder.

I confess, "It was awful... and it was all my fault."

Kimberly's view...

Startled by that woman's actions, I jerk back and throw up my hands as all I think is don't touch me. This is a little more personal than I wanted to get, and I look around the room for an escape, but I'm stuck. All I wanted that woman to do was talk to me. I don't want to comfort her, and I especially don't want to be touching her this much.

Katharine's view...

"Everything was fine at Chad's place at first–" I begin my tale as my body involuntarily shakes with my sorrow, "–then these Un-Men were delivered. Before I could stop them, the bodyguards activated them. The Factory's original programming was never removed, and the Un-Men tried to kill me. They shot up the house and nearly killed everyone."

I find some comfort as I press my face into the shoulder of the one who refers to herself as the Phoenix. She doesn't put her arms around me but maybe this is enough. It's enough to know that she's here, and she won't think bad of me.

Kimberly's view...

For Ares' sake! She is cursed! And I'm the one stuck with her. If that woman wasn't connected to my mom somehow, I'd get rid of her. I'd give her something to whine about.

I halfheartedly pat her back as if I'm burping a baby and say, "It's okay. You're not cursed. It's the Factory's fault, not yours. They're the ones who messed up the Un-Men's programming so don't worry about it."

Katharine's view...

The pats on my back seem hollow somehow, but I still feel safe and... I almost feel like I've been here before, not the tearless crying part, but that Kimberly has consoled me before, a real consoling, and that warm sensation of an imagined friendship makes me feel a whole lot better. I want her to reassure me. I want her to convince me it's not my fault.

"Maybe, but they wouldn't have shot up the house if I wasn't there. Doesn't that make me cursed? Shouldn't I stay away from people? After all, I am Pandora. I cause nothing but pain."

Kimberly's view...

I roll my eyes. Oh for Ares' sake! Is everything about her? She needs to get over herself. I shake my head in disgust. Is this the mighty Pandora Project? Talk about whiny...

I force myself to lie and say, "No... Of course not. Don't let them have power over you."

Katharine's view...

She did it... Kimberly has come to my rescue, and I don't feel as bad about what happened at Chad's house. I can stop crying.

"You're right." I sit up, wiping away my imaginary tears. "I shouldn't give them power over me." I wipe my nose and tell her, "Thanks for talking. I feel a little better."

Kimberly's view...

I lift my hands as if I'm covered in snot, edged my way off the seat, and escape around the couch as I tell her, "Anytime."

I quickly make my way into the kitchen and grab my knapsack from a bar stool. I better get going before that woman decides we need to braid each other's hair or some other girlfriend bonding ritual. I've got a job and for this Closing, I'm going to take a taxi.

"Going somewhere?" that woman questions me.

"Yes, I shouldn't be gone more than a couple of hours."

Katharine's view...

Kimberly leaves the apartment and after a few minutes, I glance around the quiet empty room and decide I'll get some fresh air. I walk to the front door, take one step into the hall, and look back. Once I close the door, it'll automatically lock, and I won't be able to get back in. I'm stuck either in the apartment or out till Kimberly comes back.

"Out for a stroll?" the man from earlier questions me as he returns to his apartment.

I turn to the fairly nice looking man and say as I remain in the doorway, "Hey, I know you."

"I passed you in the hall, not twenty minutes ago."

"No, it was before that. You made a delivery here about a week ago."

He looks at the apartment and then says, "You're right. Good memory." He scratches the back of his head and states, "You caught me. I was so impressed with the apartment when I made the delivery, I decided to rent one. I now live in Apartment G." He motions to his place and says, "We're neighbors." He walks over to me, offers his hand, and says, "I don't think I introduced myself before. The name's Zax."

"Kat," I state as I shake his hand.

"Are you out for a stroll?"

"I was, but I'm only a guest here and don't have a key. Okay not a key, but you know, a way back in."

"Yes, the voice command system. I guess you're stuck until your friend returns." Zax points his thumb over his shoulder and says, "I passed her as I came out of the elevator."

"Her name's Kimberly."

"You should have your friend add your voice to the door system."

That would be nice, but I doubt she'd go for it. Kimberly barely rates me as a guest so forget about a roommate.

Zax starts for his door and then says, "It's kind of odd now that I think of it."

"What is?"

"Your friend was mumbling about something she had to do or something about Brownstone Street." Zax shrugs and then says, "I guess it's really none of my business." He commands, "Door unlock. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to knock."

His apartment opens and he goes in, leaving me to think over his puzzling statement. Brownstone Street... but that's where Melissa's safe house is. I enter Apartment H, press the button, and the door slides closed. I go to the coffee table and grab my tea, wondering why Kimberly would be going to Brownstone Street. She was wearing her work clothes. I think about it some more. Melissa told me when I was at her safe house that Valhalla hired a Life Closer. Kimberly wouldn't. She said she's taking a break from being the Phoenix. Kimberly wouldn't, she has no time. She's searching for her mom's murderer. I down the last of my Chai. Would Kimberly lie to me? She can't be going to a Closing. I walk into the kitchen and throw the cup away. What am I thinking? Of course, she would lie to me, and she did take her knapsack but that means– I grab my backpack and rush out of the apartment.

"–that means the Phoenix was hired to kill Melissa!"

I race for the elevator. I can't let her do it!

End Katharine's view...

Earlier inside Apartment G...

After a few minutes, Zax dialed a number on his cell and then said, "Delivery Man here, I need to speak with R.G." He waited for a few moments, and then he stated, "It's done. I informed Katharine as you told me." Zax listened, and then he spoke, "I believe she'll make the connection." He looked at the monitor displaying Apartment H's kitchen and living room, and he saw her walk to the stove. "One moment." Zax turned up the volume so he could listen.

"–that means the Phoenix was hired to kill Melissa!"

Zax turned down the volume and then spoke into the cell, "Tell R.G., mission accomplished. Katharine made the connection. She's on her way."
Chapter Thirty-one

Roads Collide

1:45 P.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

Nikolai and Natasha walked through the revolving doors leading into the lobby of the Bes Hotel, and the area was busy with people checking in and out. The two made their way to an elevator, entered the empty cab, and pressed the button for the top floor.

"Tomorrow is the day," Natasha said in her thick accent. "We can complete the Closing for the Phoenix and leave this dreadful Dark Half."

"This place is not completely dreadful, my sister. I find the Dry Clouds impressive." He held his hat in his hand as he said, "They are like watching a pack of wolves stalk the land."

"You do have an imagination, my brother." Natasha changed the subject. "Are there any special instructions for the Phoenix Closing?"

"There are two," Nikolai answered as he removed an H.H.C. from his suit pocket. "We are to wait for the Phoenix to complete his or her Closing before we complete ours and if the Phoenix is unable to complete his or her Closing, we are to acquire the file and complete the task."

Natasha questioned, "There will be a bonus?"

"Yes," Nikolai answered. "Voice will compensate us if we take the second Closing."

Once they arrived at their destination, they proceeded out of the elevator.

"Where are we going, my brother? You have been very secretive."

"There is something I want to show you. Something I think you will like. We will be there shortly, so for the rest of our journey, we will need to take the stairs."

Earlier on the rooftop...

Kimberly's view...

I make sure no one follows me up and that no one else is here, and then I walk to a ledge overlooking Brownstone Street. The sky ever dark dominates the brightly lit city like a black dragon standing before a candle that with one flick of its massive tail, can extinguish the flame.

I remove binoculars from my knapsack and peer through them at a well-lit house across the road. I see a bike messenger run up the stoop and ring the buzzer, and then I see a man answer the door. The Mark has bodyguards. I remove an H.H.C. from my knapsack and open the Closing File, and it's on Melissa Odin. The Mark's Closing's not until tomorrow. I don't know if I can take the Mark out with a rifle if the Mark doesn't leave the house, so I'll have to go in. If I go in, I'll have to take out the bodyguards. I scan the file and discover that the Mark has a little girl. I hope for her sake the Mark sent her to live with a relative. I don't need another Moscow.

I put the device away and then glance up, hearing a rumbling overhead as a He-Zeppelin soars beneath the Dry Clouds. The airship's twin engines roar, cutting through the thick atmosphere. A raven flies next to the He-Zeppelin, dives, and lands on the ledge down from me, and I look at the bird. The raven tilts its head, staring at me with dark eyes and caws, and then some dog or something howls in the distance. I turn my attention back to the airship as a message in green neon letters runs across the He-Zeppelin's side.

"Crite. The taste of lemon and lime. Refresh your taste buds. Buy two twelve packs and receive one free, so buy some Crite today."

Stupid ad, now I'm thirsty. The corporation probably placed subliminal messages in it. I remove a bottle of water from my knapsack. It's not Crite, but it will have to do. I take a couple of drinks, put the bottle back, and peer through the binoculars again. The stoop's empty as several cars drive along Brownstone Street and people stroll the sidewalk. A yellow taxi pulls up to the curb in front of the house and after about a minute, the taxi continues down the road. I try to see who got out. Whoever they are, they look a little lost. I watch the figure who's standing alone on the sidewalk and the person glances in my direction. Is that Katharine? I focus on her face. It is. What's she doing here? That strange woman stares up at the rooftop and appears to be looking at me. I bet she followed me here. No, I've been here too long, and she just arrived. Katharine turns, walks up the steps to the stoop, and rings the buzzer. A bodyguard opens the door. They speak, and he shakes his head. The bodyguard closes the door, and that woman remains outside. She seems to be very anxious. What did that woman say to him and what could she possibly be here for? She can't be telling them I'm up here. She doesn't know. I bite my lip. She can't possibly know. I wish I had taken that course on lip reading.

The bodyguard returns with another man, and they both walk out to the stoop after closing the door behind them. This second man's bald and speaks with Katharine for a while. Occasionally, the first bodyguard says something, and the discussion seems heated at times and after a few minutes, the second man gives in over the objection of the first, and they let her in. For Ares' sake! I stand, placing the binoculars in my knapsack. I have a mind to march down there and drag that woman out of that house. I pace for a few minutes. She has to know that I'm up here, but I can't see how. I start for the rooftop door. I'll worry about the how later. The idiot! I wish she had a phone, and then I'd give her a piece of my mind. No one interferes with my job! I arrive at the door and move my hand to turn the knob when the knob turns on its own, and I quickly duck around the side as two people wearing WM-Bs wander out.

"See," a man starts as he strolls toward the edge with the woman's arm locked around his. He places his hat on as he says, "The Dry Clouds are impressive up here."

I glance around the corner and get a look at the two. They seem familiar, but I can't place them. The woman wears a white fur-lined black coat that flows to her ankles, and the man wears a white pinstriped gray business suit and Fedora. I reach for my PPK, and then I change my mind about drawing the gun. It doesn't matter who they are, as soon as I can, I'm getting out of here.

The woman presses a button on the side of her mask and speaks, "I see what you mean about them. I can almost see the wolves. The pack is anxious." She releases her hold on his arm and places her hands on the railing, scanning the sky. "Is this what you wanted to show me?"

"This is part of it," he answers and searches the rooftop as if he expects to see something. "I was hoping for another."

While the two have their backs to me, I slip around the corner and make for the exit.

"What is the other?" the woman questions.

I hear something speed by my face and something cuts my cheek before embedding in the door. "Hades!"

I turn and face the two and see that the woman threw a throwing knife at me.

She asks, "Is this creature the one you were waiting for?"

I draw my PPK and aim for the black haired woman. I guess getting out of here won't be so easy.

"Yes," he answers. "The little firebird I presume." He removes a Glock 25 from a shoulder holster and aims it at me. "We finally meet the Phoenix."

Somehow they know my name, but I admit to nothing as I ask, "Who are you?"

She replies, "By now, you should know we are like you."

"Like me? Who do you think I am?"

"A Life Closer of course," she answers. "One that has been sloppy."

I aim for the man as I place my free hand behind my back and reach for the knob. I demand, "Who hired you?"

"Voice," he replies.

The woman turns to him and asks, "Brother, are you going to tell her everything?"

He sounds like some sort of gangster as he answers, "Does it matter? She'll be sleeping with the fishes soon."

I'm surprised Voice is the one who sent them, and I decide not to escape right away. I might learn some valuable intel from them. I do continue my act and question, "Who or what is this voice?"

"Do not play simple-minded with us," she says. "We know that you are the Phoenix. You cannot deny it."

"I'm not saying I am this Life Closer you mentioned, but tell me something. Why does this voice want me dead? What did I do?"

"You should not have to ask," he states. "It is Guild business. Remember you botched the Moscow assignment. It is grounds enough for your Closing."

They know about Moscow, so then they must work for Voice. No need to pretend my ignorance, but botched?

I admit to them, "Sure I missed the first shot, but the backup took out Mrs. Serqet's little girl before I had a chance to take my second shot."

She informs me, "Phoenix, you had no backup."

"Sure I did. I saw Maestro's business card when it was handed to the detective. He or she claimed the kill."

They glance at one another.

"Do you know nothing?" he questions me. "Maestro's alias has been retired for ten years. Maestro is dead."

"It does not matter," the woman states. "It is your alias that was recorded as the Life Closer. The Assassins League has your ID logged as the one who killed the child. You are the lowest of low. You are a Life Closer who cannot hit her Mark."

"This is a mistake. I need to clear this up with Voice. I heard the detective say Maestro," I mumble to myself as I reach for the knob again. "I know I did."

"That is not our problem," she states as she reaches into her sleeve. "You of all people should know the rules. Only Voice or Thanatos can cancel a Closing."

"Oh, I know."

If this comes to a fight, I'll take the man out first. The woman does seem very skillful with the knives, but I still believe that at this distance, he'll be the bigger threat.

"I wasn't saying we should hold this off, but you can at least do me the courtesy of telling me your names. You already know mine."

"That was rude of us," he says, and then he bows his head in greeting and states, "I am the Raven, and my sister is the Wolf."

Is the Moscow assignment the only reason Voice sent these two after me? Does Voice know I lied about Katharine and I didn't kill her? I bite my lip. Will I have to eliminate her before we finish our deal? I might have to if I want to get back into good standing with the Assassins Guild. I would prefer to wait till after that woman helps me and I have no further need of her, but I can't have everything I want. I study the man and woman, and I believe I've gotten all the information I'm going to get from them, so I prepare to flee as I tell them, "Well, let's get this over wi–"

The knob I'm holding turns on its own, and the door opens as I whirl around and aim for the newest member of the rooftop club. The person walks out as I yell, "You've got to be kidding! What are you doing here?"

"Me?" Katharine yells as she glares at me with hazel eyes that accuse. "What are you doing here?"

Panic sweeps across me as I step back, and that woman raises her gun in response to me aiming at her. I don't know if I should fire or not. There's something in the way that woman's looking at me. It's as if I betrayed her.

"You didn't answer me," Katharine yells as she steps further out onto the roof, breathing as if she ran all the way up the stairs. She notices the man and woman standing near the ledge. "Kimberly, what are you doing here?"

The Raven aims his Glock at Katharine and questions, "Who is this?"

"Perhaps another Closer," the Wolf answers. "Maybe Voice is not convinced we can complete our Closing or maybe Voice has sent another to make sure we kill the Phoenix's Mark if she does not do so."

Katharine's view...

I peer at the man and woman, trying to figure out why they're here. I thought the Russian woman said they'll kill Melissa if Kimberly fails. I turn my attention to my partner. I'm right, Kimberly's here to kill Melissa, but how can she take on another Closing when she told me she wouldn't?

The tension increases as those of us with guns divide our time between pointing our weapon at the other two as something else crosses my mind. They could be Closers, and they could be here to kill Kimberly. I can't think about that right now. I have to focus on one thing at a time. First, I have to deal with Kimberly. My tone makes it clear I'm not too happy with my partner as I state while I keep my Beretta leveled on her, ignoring the others, "We need to talk."

"Fine with me," Kimberly says. "But could we do it someplace more private? It's getting a little crowded up here."

I glance at the other two. I've seen them somewhere. I take a second look at the man and woman, and I realize they were at the Genesis Arboretum.

I ask my partner, "Making new friends?"

"Funny," Kimberly snaps. "Are you wanting that talk or not?"

"Then you know why I'm here? Because I know why you're here."

"If you know why I'm here, then I can guess why you're here," Kimberly replies.

"Then you know I won't let you do it. I'll stop you. I won't let you kill anyone. This has to end–"

The Russian woman leans to her brother and inquires, "What are they bickering about?"

"I am not sure. I am very confused. And I am not even sure they know what they are arguing about. The conversation seems to be going in circles."

"Kill anyone?" Kimberly interrupts me. "How could you possibly know I'm here to..? Never mind. What's more important is–"

The Russian woman clears her throat and then speaks to us, "Excuse me. Do not forget about us. We are feeling very left out, and we were the first guests."

"I haven't forgotten about you," Kimberly tells her. "But do you mind, I'm trying to have a conversation here. Talk about rude." She turns back to me and asks, "Where was I?"

"Maybe this conversation would be better in private," I tell her. "Truce till we're done with these two?"

"Truce," Kimberly answers. "What's the plan?"

"We should find better cover. After you–" I say as I motion to the open door with my head. "–and hurry. I think the Life Closers' polite talk is coming to an end."

Kimberly backs up, then turns, and races down the stairs.

"It was very rude of you to interfere," the Russian woman tells me as she unsheathes a throwing knife. "Do you not know there are sweets that are treats and Sweets that can kill?"

"Sweets that you eat? And sweets that can kill? You mean like choking on a cookie?" I question. "I almost did earlier this morning. I thought I was going to die, but before I actually choked–"

"Cookie..?" the woman repeats, and then her face goes all feral as she yells, "No, I am talking about this."

She lifts the throwing knife so I can see it.

"Oh... Sorry... Sometimes I'm a little slow on the uptake." I gave Kimberly enough of a head start, so I trigger my Beta Phase as I say, "Why don't you drop the knife?"

She notices the light coming from my eyes, but it doesn't seem to phase her as she draws her hand back and questions, "Why would I want to drop my knife?"

I fire before she throws it, and the bullet strikes the blade, knocking the weapon from her hand. I turn the gun on the man before he reacts and warn him, "Don't do it! Just take it easy. I made sure not to hurt her."

"She did hurt me!" the woman screeches as she rubs her hand. "Kill her!"

He snarls and then yells before firing, "No one hurts my sister!"

"Oh crap!"

I run through the door and down the stairs as several bullets whizz past me. One nicks me on the side of my chin as I flee, and soon they're pursuing me. I burst through the door to the highest level the elevator comes up to, and I run to the elevator, finding Kimberly waiting for me.

"About time you got here." Kimberly presses the lobby button, and the elevator doors close.

"Actually," I say out of breath. "I didn't think you'd wait."

"Well... I wouldn't have, but we still need to have our talk."
Chapter Thirty-two

Protect The One's You Love

Twenty-five minutes earlier...

Before going up to the roof...

Katharine's view...

The taxi I was in pulls away, leaving me standing on the sidewalk across from Bes Hotel. I stare at Melissa Odin's safe house, praying I'm not too late, and then I turn and look up at the tops of the buildings across the street. Kimberly could be up on any one of those buildings taking aim, so I stare a little longer but don't see her, so I walk up the stairs to the stoop and ring the buzzer.

After a few seconds, Daniels answers and questions me, "What are you doing here?" He shakes his head as he tells me, "I'm not letting you in."

"You have to!" I yell, knowing time's not on my side, and then I insist, "I need to talk to Johnson. Melissa's life depends on it."

He tells me, "I think you need to leave." Daniels removes his gun and states as if I don't know already, "It's been decided we don't need you."

I know he now views me as a threat, so I try not to raise my voice as I insist, "Yes, you do. I know who the Life Closer is. I know who has been sent to take out Melissa." I plead with him, "Please, let me speak with Johnson."

Daniels thinks about it for a few seconds, then exhales loudly, and says, "Fine, wait here."

He enters the house and closes the door behind himself. I turn and look back at Brownstone Street. A truck honks at what looks like a large dog as it darts across the road to Bes Hotel. I turn back to the door, wait about a minute, and then Daniels returns with Johnson. Both men walk out to the stoop, and Daniels recloses the door.

Johnson glances around, surveying the people using the sidewalks and going by in vehicles. He turns his attention to me and says, "Daniels tells me you know who the Life Closer is."

"The Phoenix."

Johnson removes an H.H.C. and punches in the name Phoenix as I move to the side of him and watch. A file appears with data collected by the Isis Corporation, and then he states, "This isn't good." He scans page after page, and then he adds, "The Phoenix is very good."

"Yes, that's why you need me," I speak, and then I try to convince him by saying, "I've had dealings with the Phoenix in the past. I can help."

"We can't let her in," Daniels protests. "We hardly know anything about her. All we really know is that she's the Pandora Project. It is what the Un-Men called her." He still grips his gun tightly as he questions, "What does that mean really? For all we know, it's a Life Closer name."

Johnson types Pandora Project on his H.H.C., and I watch with interest, seeing if the Isis Corporation has anything on me. Unfortunately, no file appears.

"No, there's no Life Closer by any version of that name," Johnson states.

"It doesn't mean we should let her in."

"I know there isn't any reason why you should trust me," I begin. "But you've seen what I can do. I'll put my life out there for Chad, Melissa, and Bonnie. I won't let anything happened to them."

"Johnson don't. Don't let her words sway you. You have to think of this family." Daniels insists, "We have to protect them."

I think of something and ask, "Were you able to call in reinforcements?"

"No," Johnson replies. "We're it. I guess the Isis Corporation believes Valhalla won't kill Ms. Odin. She's too valuable alive."

"Then you need me."

"You're right," Johnson tells Daniels. "We have to protect this family no matter the cost." Johnson turns to me and stares at me as if he's searching for something and then after a few moments, he tells me, "Kat, welcome to the team but know–" His voice and eyes change as they go eerily dark, and he threatens me, "–if you cause any harm to this family, I'll personally end you." His expression returns to normal, and he steps to the side to let me in as he says, "Let's go talk to Ms. Odin."

Inside the kitchen...

"You think it's a good idea to have her here?" Melissa questions Johnson as if I'm not standing right in front of her. She looks exhausted, and I feel sorry for her over the predicament she's in.

"Yes," Johnson answers.

Melissa glances at the other bodyguard and says, "Daniels doesn't seem so sure."

"She did take out five Un-Men," Andrews speaks up.

Melissa doesn't seem to be listening to the conversation she's apart of and asks Andrews, "How are the children?"

"Fine. Chad dragged his mattress into Bonnie's room and is resting on the floor and with him there, the little girl has fallen asleep and is taking a nap." Andrews walks over to a coffee pot, pours himself a cup, and says, "I'm only in here to get some Java."

Johnson turns to me and asks me, "What's your plan?"

My plan? I didn't have one when I rode over here in the taxi, and I still don't. I just need time to figure out what's really going on.

I remove my backpack and place it on the stool as I say, "I know someone who might help with the Phoenix if I can convince her. I'm going to go talk with her now."

"You're leaving?" Daniels questions me. "Can't you call this person?"

I think for a moment, and then I reply, "I don't know her number. I'll have to talk with her face to face."

"What if the Phoenix strikes while you're gone?" Daniels asks.

"I don't have an answer for that. We do need her if we're going to stop the Phoenix, so I'll hurry," I say as I remove my Beretta from the backpack and tuck it in the front of my pants. I zip up my athletic jacket, pull it over the gun to hide the weapon, and then I say, "Whatever you do, don't go outside. The Phoenix likes to attack from a distance."

I hurry and go out the front door and cross the street to the Bes Hotel and in an alley down from me, I catch sight of the dog that darted in front of the truck. I see that the animal's not a dog but a wolf. The wolf observes me, raises its head, and howls a warning, and then I could swear I hear a raven return its call as I rush inside the hotel and then to the roof.

The present...

The numbers above the elevator doors light up as the elevator passes each level. Kimberly dabs the cut on her cheek with a white handkerchief from her knapsack. The knife cut looks superficial, and the bleeding soon stops.

"Do you think they'll be waiting for us in the lobby?" I ask as I glance at Kimberly.

She answers me, "Even if they beat us to the bottom, they won't engage us with people around. They're too professional. They'll wait for some secluded place."

I brought the gun with me to protect Chad but now's not the time to use it. I need to talk with Kimberly first, so I set the safety on the Beretta and tuck it back in the front of my pants. The doors open to the lobby, and both of us walk out, scanning the crowd. We don't see the Wolf or the Raven, so we start for the front when I notice a lady's room.

"Let's go to the bathroom," I say as I push Kimberly in ahead of myself.

"Now..?" Kimberly protests as I force her in. "Can't you wait?"

I lock the main door and check to see if anyone else is in the bathroom, and the stalls are all empty.

"Okay, all clear," I say, then turn to my supposed partner, and state, "Now we can talk."

Kimberly's view...

"Right," I mutter and would rather be any place else but here. That woman somehow knows what I'm up to or I think she does.

"Kimmie, how could you?" that woman yells at me like we're friends and I borrowed her favorite shirt without permission. She slams her palm on the sink and shouts, "You've taken a Closing! You're here to kill Melissa Odin!"

I am right. That woman does know why I'm here. I don't know how, but it makes me very upset that she's trying to interfere. All of that is bad enough but the name she called me... that woman... she... I should just... I snap at her, "I told you never to call me that! Only my mom called me that!" I jab my finger into that woman's shoulder and tell her, "And yes, I took a Life Closing! For Ares' sake, I'm an assassin! It's my job!"

That woman folds her arms and sulks like some child, "But you said you were going to take a break. You said you were going to focus on finding Theresa's murderer and help me discover my past."

I can't believe this is what she dragged me into the bathroom to talk about. I just happened to change my mind. I'll try to explain this to her because right now I do need her help. I need her to face those two Life Closers.

"Fine. I did say that, but Voice wanted me to take one last job before my break. I couldn't say no. It's my job, and I have a responsibility to it."

I don't believe she has accepted my explanation for that woman paces the bathroom like some lunatic, and then she questions me, "Are the man and woman Life Closers? Who are they after?"

"They're known as the Raven and the Wolf. They're here to kill me?"

"Why?"

"It's Assassins Guild business," I answer, not wanting to share.

Someone knocks on the main door.

We both ignore it as that woman yells at me, "How many times do I have to say it? We're partners and you can't keep things like this from me. I need to know why they're after you."

I don't like the way she's talking to me, and I tell her, "Just so we're clear on this, we're only partners till we find my mom's killer."

"Are you going to keep things from me?" that woman asks and then turns and looks at herself in the mirror, noticing a cut on her chin's bleeding. She grabs a paper towel and dabs it as she persists in her questioning, "Why are the Raven and the Wolf here to kill you?"

"Fine!" I yell as I throw my arms up and give into her interrogation. "They're here because of my Life Closing in Moscow. It was my first failed attempt and after I missed the primary shot, I went to the second kill spot, but a second Life Closer was already there. One known as Maestro. The Closer accidentally killed the Mark's little girl. Somehow I got blamed for it. Even so... It was my first mistake and collateral damage happens a lot." I mostly say to myself, "I don't understand why Voice wants to eliminate me."

"What can you do?" that woman questions me as she stops the bleeding and throws the paper towel away.

Someone knocks again on the locked door, and we both ignore it.

"You mean, besides killing the Closers? I can try to contact Thanatos, leader of the Assassins Union. I can plead my case with him and maybe find out why the Closing was ordered."

"Okay, we'll hide out at Melissa's place till you can contact Thanatos."

"Idiot! Are you that stupid?" I yell at her as I can't believe how brainless she is, and I decide I have to make her understand just exactly the way things are, so I tell her, "Just because these Closers are after me, doesn't mean I'm not going to complete my assignment. For Ares' sake! Your best plan is to walk me into my Mark's safe house?" I'm dying to know why she's so persistent with this inane tactic of hers, so I ask, "Why were you at Ms. Odin's anyway? If I have to, I'll kill everyone in that house to get my Mark."

I immediately see my error in letting my vindictiveness speak first as that woman glares at me like she has never done before. Her eyes ignite in anger and the blue Ult L-E... She had tried to explain what it was to me, but I mostly ignored her... like I care why she's a freak. The blue Ult L-E lights up her entire face, making her look like some angry demon, and she charges at me, grabs me by my shirt, and slams me up against the outside of the stalls.

"No, you won't!" that woman screams at me. "Chad's in there! He's in there, and I'm going to protect him!"

Stupid me. I never caught on, but now I understand, and all I can think of is what's with my luck lately? Of all the people to be in that safe house, why did it have to be that boy, Chad? The odds of this happening are off the charts!

I'm afraid of what she'll do to me so, with one quick motion, I pull my gun, place it against that woman's temple, and shout, "You're nuts! Now let go." I struggle against her, but I can't budge her, so I demand, "I said let go!"

"Promise me, you'll hurt no one," she says as she angrily squeezes my shirt in her fists. "Promise me! No one else will die!"

I cock the gun as the blue light coming from her eyes moves towards me as if it'll devour both of us, but I manage to remain calm as I reply, "You know I can't." I won't hesitate to pull the trigger, but I would prefer to wait. I still need that woman to at least deal with the Life Closers. I wait on her next move, but she just stares at me with those freakish eyes of hers, and I feel as though we're in a deadlock, so I ask, "Now what?"

For a third time, someone knocks on the bathroom door, and we both yell, "Hold it! We're busy in here!"

"Hurry," a woman groans. "I don't think I can wait that much longer."

Katharine's view...

I peer into my partner's face and as I do, I realize what I must look like. I came at her like some rapid tigress. I take a deep breath, my anger lessens, and I feel my eyes lose their glow. It wasn't that long ago that Kimberly was consoling me. I don't think I could hurt her. Kimberly's the one person who can understand me. If only she would be there for me like she was at the apartment. If only I could convince Kimberly that her way of life is wrong.

I release Kimberly, walk back to the sink, and lean on it and in a calm voice, I ask, "Can you at least promise me you won't kill Melissa until we've taken care of the Raven and the Wolf?"

Kimberly's view...

I'm surprised by how quickly she surrendered. I imagined our tumultuous partnership ending in this bathroom, but she gave in. I believe she thinks she can sway me, she can sway the gun of a Life Closer. Good thing for me. I can use her naivete.

I uncock my gun and inquire, "Taken care of the Raven and the Wolf? Why are you worried about them?"

"They're after you," that woman replies as she stares into the mirror, and I hear the sweet wholeheartedness of a tyke in her voice. She vehemently asserts, "I have to save you."

That woman again surprises me. I don't believe it's an act. I honestly believe she's concerned about me.

That woman turns to me and adds, "I also heard them say they would kill Melissa if you don't."

She's an idiot. A real honest-to-gods idiot! There has to be something wrong with her. She can't save everyone and surely she knows that. That woman should also know she can't trust anyone. I thought I had at least taught her that, but she keeps putting her faith in me. I don't understand why she puts her faith in me especially after what I've done to her. For Ares' sake! No one can be this stupid.

I holster my weapon as I consider my other headache. This entire mess concerning my own Life Closing started in Moscow. I have such bad karma. I mean just look at the last three Closings I've had in a row. They were all disasters.

I consider once again the faith that woman has in me, and I tell her, "Fine, I promise."

That woman will have to learn the hard way that people lie, and if it takes someone dying to get it across to her, well... I guess that's what it'll take.

She walks over to me and reaches out her hand. "Shake on it."

"Whatever you want," I tell her and shake her hand. "Can we get out of here now?"

"Yes, just one thing before we leave." She walks over to the mirror and grabs a handful of peppermints from a bowl on the sink.

"Got a sweet tooth?"

"They're for the kids," she answers. "Aunt Kat and Aunt Kim are coming for a visit."

"I know I'm really going to hate this," I say as I unlock the door, and a woman rushes in past us and pulls down her pants as she hurriedly heads into a stall. I wave for Katharine as I say, "Come on."
Chapter Thirty-three

Cerberus And The Council

1:45 P.M...

The Chamber...

The door opened, letting light from the hall brightened the area, and the Council paused as a figure stepped in. Analysts hushed and halted their work, recognizing the one who entered. None of them dared make a sound. They didn't want to attract its attention.

"Cerberus, you have returned," Mr. Morta said. "Did you track down Pandora? Have you been able to observe Pandora?"

"Yeah," Stephanie replied as she closed the door, plunging the Chamber back to partial darkness illuminated by a computer-blue glow. "She's not what I expected?"

"Not what you expected?" Surprised by its statement, Mr. Decuma asked, "Did you make contact with Pandora?"

"Yeah," Stephanie answered as she walked across the room and stood before them. "I learned a lot from my encounter."

Disappointed with its actions, Mr. Decuma stated, "You were told not to make contact. Why did you disobey our orders?"

"Actually, I was told not to kill Pandora, and I was told I could monitor her."

Ms. Nona asked, "When did monitoring mean making contact?"

"What better way to understand the prey than to get close, to study her habits, and to see why she does things?" Stephanie added, "What better way to find her weaknesses?"

"Have you?" Mr. Morta asked as he noticed Cerberus was biting at its leash. The Council would have to keep a close eye on this experiment. Cerberus said nothing, so Mr. Morta repeated his question, "Have you discovered Pandora's weaknesses?"

"A couple," Stephanie answered as she thought of the boy. "I can use them to exploit her." She placed her hands on the table, looked into each of the Council's faces, and asked, "When will you let me kill her?" Stephanie glared at them as if willing them to give her the answer she desired. "How much longer do I have to wait? I want to kill her now!"

Mr. Morta activated the center screen, and it lowered.

"The bio-data we received from Pandora is inconclusive," Ms. Nona stated as she studied the outline of the female body on the center screen. "The readings seem to indicate Pandora has reached the Delta Phase but–"

"But there is no indication that Pandora ever reached Gamma," Mr. Decuma interrupted. "Without reaching that phase, there is no way it reached the Delta."

"Does that mean our readings are correct?" Mr. Morta asked. "Do we have no further need for the Pandora Project or is something eluding our sight?"

"Nothing eludes us," Ms. Nona said. "Pandora is a failure."

Stephanie's eyes brightened as she inquired, "Then you'll let me kill–"

"Yes," Mr. Morta replied as he reluctantly gave in. "It means you can eliminate Pandora. We have no further need for that project."

Stephanie clapped her hands like an excited child. "Finally, I thought I was going to have to disobey my orders."

Mr. Morta caught her last statement; it seemed they might have more than one defiant experiment. He ordered, "Report to the Infirmary. You will go through one final checkup before your mission."

"Awe... Come on! Do I have to?"

"Yes," Mr. Decuma replied. "Do not make us repeat ourselves."

"Oh, alright." Stephanie headed for the door. "But when I'm done, I'm going after her."

After the experiment left...

Mr. Decuma turned to the larger man and asked, "Why did you send Cerberus to the Infirmary?"

"It will give Argus time to get into position. He is gathering his equipment as we speak," Mr. Morta said. "I want him to follow Cerberus. The experiment has an embedded tracking beacon but still, I want no more unmonitored excursions into Noir. I have seen signs of insubordination from Cerberus. The experiment needs to be watched. We do not need a rogue."

Ms. Nona and Mr. Decuma nodded.

Mr. Decuma leaned back pleased with himself. "Cerberus will finally prove it is superior, and we will be rid of the useless Pandora."

* * *

1:51 P.M...

Elsewhere in the Sanctum...

Peters and Maxwell skittishly glanced around the hall and walked into the armory where Argus packed a duffle bag with equipment. A cane leaned against the table. Argus' cuts and scrapes were mostly healed, and he favored his bruised ribs.

"Is the Council sending you out on a job?" Maxwell asked.

Argus nodded to the heavy set tech.

"Are they sending you after Pandora?" Peters questioned.

"No." Argus paused from packing. "I'm to follow Cerberus."

"Oh..." Peters replied.

Argus turned to the techs and questioned them, "Why did you want to know?"

Maxwell answered, "We feel kind of bad. I mean, Pandora rescued us from the Factory, and all we did in the past was hurt her."

Argus moved to the men and questioned them, "What do you mean?"

"About eight months ago, the Factory captured Pandora." Peters quieted his voice. "We were part of the group who experimented on her and some of the stuff we did..." He paused, unable to finish the sentence.

"Some of the stuff we did was harsh," Maxwell admitted. "Torture, to be exact."

"You were the ones!" Argus glared at the techs till he thought about his own role in the ordeal, and his anger vanished. "You're afraid of what Pandora might do if she finds out." He went back to packing his duffle. "Will she come after you and take her revenge?" Argus placed several magazines to his M4 in the bag.

The techs nodded as Argus zipped up the equipment, and Argus said, "You might not have to worry about that."

"Why's that?" Maxwell asked.

"Cerberus is being sent to take out Pandora."

"What..?" Peters shouted and looked outside to the hall to see if he caught the attention of anyone. No one seemed to notice, so he turned back. "Cerberus is going to kill Pandora?"

"And you're going to watch?" Maxwell uttered, folded his arms, and asked, "Aren't you?"

"It is my job." Argus grabbed his black trench coat from a bench and put it on. "I'm not to hinder or help." He picked up his M4 from a table, slung the assault rifle over his shoulder, grabbed the cane, and headed for the door. "My job is to watch." The cane made little sound as its rubber tip struck the floor.

"Even after she saved you?" Peters asked.

Argus stopped beside the techs and looked at them. "If the Council captured Pandora, brought her in here, and ordered you to experiment on her, would you? Would you even after she saved you?"

Peters and Maxwell frowned, knowing they would for fear of their own life.

"Then leave me to my dark path. You have your own to walk." Argus continued out. He wished he could be more like Kat. He wished he could help when his heart beckoned.
Chapter Thirty-four

Closers, Closers, And More Closers

2:41 P.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

Bes Hotel...

Katharine's view...

We walk out of the lady's restroom and head for the hotel's entrance. We scan the crowd for the Raven and the Wolf. The lobby bustles with people, and we don't see any sign of them.

"Hurry!" Kimberly shouts in a whisper as she increases her pace. "Out the front!"

"I'm coming," I tell her as I follow her.

The Raven and the Wolf exit an elevator to the left side of us, and they spot us.

Nikolai's view...

I motion with my head and say in a calm voice to my sister, "There they are."

Natasha reaches her hand up her sleeve, going for her knives.

I put a hand on her arm and tell her, "Not here. There are too many people. We must wait."

She agrees with me as she says, "They are heading outside, my brother. We can kill them under the cover of darkness."

Katharine's view...

We pass the Life Closers and near the entrance of the hotel.

"Hurry!" Kimberly yells as she pushes her way out the rotating doors.

"Go on," I tell her as I pause right before the rotating doors within the hotel. "I'm going to buy us some time to cross the road."

The Raven halts along with the Wolf, and he reaches into his suit jacket ready to draw his gun. I'm hoping he has no clue what I'm about to do. They're close enough now that I can hear them talking.

"What is she up to?" the Raven questions.

"I do not know, my brother," the Wolf replies as she eyes me. "Perhaps she is giving the Phoenix some time to escape. We should continue."

I make sure they see me reach into my pocket, remove a small item, and place it on the floor in front of the rotating doors. I rush outside and join Kimberly.

Natasha's view...

I start to race after the one who seems to be protecting the Phoenix, but my brother puts his arm out, holding me back as he says, "Wait... We must be careful."

I lean to my twin brother's ear and whisper, "What do you believe she placed on the floor? Is it an explosive?"

"It could be that or some sort of toxin," Nikolai tells me as he puts his arm down. "We must be cautious. I will go and check it out. Stay here."

Nikolai slowly walks to the small item. People come in and out the front, and a few people walk over the item until someone accidentally kicks it across the floor. The round thing slides, stopping in front of my brother. He takes a step back as if he is afraid that at any moment it will explode, but nothing happens. Nikolai bents down, picks up the item in a plastic wrapper, and returns to me.

"What is it?" I ask.

Nikolai holds out his hand, showing a red and white object and says, "A peppermint candy, I think."

"A sweet? Does it have any meaning? Is the woman who's protecting the Phoenix trying to tell us something?"

"I do not believe so," he answers. "I believe she hoped it would give them time to flee."

I believe the one woman is trying to tell me something. I glance at my hidden left wrist sheath where my throwing knives are positioned. There are sweets that are treats, and Sweets that can kill. I wonder if the one woman is using my own words against me.

We move to the entrance as I question, "Where do they hope to flee?"

He points with his finger as he tells me, "Look there, they are entering that house."

I see the house, then look at the ceiling of the hotel, remembering the layout of the roof, and question, "Could that house belong to the Phoenix's Mark? Would they flee into the den of her prey?"

"I have noticed in this city that anything is possible. Come, Tasha. Let us make our plans for the assault." He walks outside, and I follow alongside him as he says, "With the Phoenix's odd behavior, perhaps Voice will let us go ahead and acquire the Mark's Closing. We can earn some extra money and proceed a little early with the Closing of the Phoenix."

"You mean–"

"Yes," Nikolai answers before I finish my sentence. "I was only toying with the Phoenix. The Closing File states we cannot kill her until tomorrow, but I know, dear sister, you are bored. The drama on the rooftop did give you enjoyment, yes?"

I wrap my arm around him, delighted with the events he helped create, and I tell him, "Yes, and I thought you only wanted to show me the Dry Clouds. You were hoping the Phoenix would show up and check out the roof's layout."

"It did help that Voice gave us the address of the Phoenix's Mark." He pats my arm and tells me, "And now that we know what the Phoenix looks like, maybe Voice will give us permission to close tonight."

"That way we can leave this dreadful Dark Half tomorrow and see the sun once again."

* * *

Minutes earlier...

Outside Bes Hotel...

Kimberly's view...

I rush to the curb and hail a taxi, and the yellow cab pulls up just as that woman walks out. I open the back passenger door and start to get in.

"Wait," that woman calls out to me, and then she questions, "What are you doing?"

"Getting out of here," I answer, and then I wave for her, wanting to hurry and leave this dreadful day behind, "Come on."

"No. We're going to Melissa's," that woman informs me as she points across the street. "If we go there, I can protect all of you."

"You're serious," I utter still in shock as to how stupid she really is. I pull out of the cab and stand on the sidewalk. "I didn't think you were serious about taking me into that house."

The taxi driver barks, "Lady! Am I driving you anywhere or what?"

I bend down and yell at the driver, "Hang on." I glance at the hotel to see if the Raven and the Wolf have come out yet, and then I turn to that woman and question her as if I need to hear it from her lips again, "You're really going to take me into that house?"

"Yes," that woman replies as she stands there, anxious to cross the street before our pursuers walk out. "You did promise you wouldn't kill anyone till we took care of the Raven and the Wolf. Come on. I didn't buy us that much time."

She looks both ways and starts across the street, and I'm left their gawking at her. An honest-to-gods idiot... I can't believe she's really going to trust me.

I slap the top of the taxi and tell him, "Sorry."

I join that woman, and we run to the other side. We pause at the sidewalk and glance back at the hotel.

"When is Melissa's Closing?"

I answer her, "Anytime Monday."

She grabs my wrist and looks at my watch. "3:07 P.M. That gives me almost nine hours. I can trust you until then, right?" She doesn't wait for an answer, hurries up to the stoop, and rings the buzzer.

"Sure," I say as I rush up the steps behind her. "You're not a complete idiot but still too trusting." I glance behind us again, and then I ask, "What are you going to tell them about me?"

One of the bodyguards answers the door and inquires, "Is this her?"

"Yes. Hurry, let us in," that woman answers as she pushes past the bodyguard. "Daniels, let Johnson know that I have more news."

I warily look at the man and follow her. I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm walking into the house of the woman I'm going to kill. I shiver and scan the living room, and it feels eerie being here. It's not my style to get chummy with the Mark before I off her. I prefer long range Closings.

Hades... I should have never taken this assignment from Voice. I think about what the Raven and the Wolf told me. Maybe there's more to Voice sending them after me. And what about Maestro? Why is my alias down as the one who killed the little girl?

Daniels locks the front door and walks into the living room, and I look at him and notice he reaches for his gun. What did he mean by is this her? What did that woman tell them? I glance at that woman who stands behind a shot-up couch. Why am I getting this sinking feeling that..?

"Kat," a man calls as he enters in from the kitchen. "Did you capture the Phoenix?"

I panic as I part my hoodie, ready to draw my gun. She tricked me! That woman brought me here only to be captured or killed, and I'm the idiot who walked into a trap!

Katharine's view...

I watch Kimberly. Am I being too evil? Am I letting her think the worse about the situation? Look at her... Kimberly has to be wondering if she made a mistake by coming here. Yes, she's thinking that, I can tell. Kimberly believes I betrayed her, and it's about time she's on the other side of the loaded barrel of doubt. I know I'm wickedly-evil because for some reason I'm getting a sick sense of pleasure out of seeing her squirm, but I better not let it go on for too long. Someone might end up getting hurt.

I answer before Kimberly does anything to blow my plans, "No, I didn't capture the Phoenix. Actually, we have another problem."

Kimberly's view...

I relax after that woman speaks, but I can't believe how easily I trusted her. If this had been a trap, it would have been all over. I put my right hand on my left shoulder as I can't understand why I trusted that woman. I never even suspected this could be a trick. I must be losing my edge. Did the Raven and the Wolf shake me up or is there another reason I'm not myself today?

Katharine's view...

Johnson looks at us and then asks, "There's another problem? What's that?"

"There are at least two Life Closers," I answer.

Johnson folds his arms as he questions me, "You know this for certain?"

"Pretty certain. I have a very reliable source. I believe they'll try to infiltrate this safe house in the next thirty-three hours." I glance at Kimberly, turn back to Johnson, and say, "I'm not sure about the rules for Life Closers, but I discovered the Closing date for Melissa. It's tomorrow, Monday. If we can hold off till Tuesday, we'll be in the clear, right?"

"It's correct," Johnson answers me. "If you're right about the date."

"What do we do?" Andrews questions. "What do we do for the next thirty-three hours?"

"Prepare," I tell them. "Prepare for the battle." I glance at Kimberly again and add, "Be more prepared than the Closers."

The four of us enter the kitchen and there Melissa sits at the kitchen bar, sipping on coffee. Her hands shake slightly. Melissa glances up as we enter.

"Melissa, this is Kim," I tell her.

"This is the woman who's going to help us with our Phoenix problem," Melissa states as she stands and offers her hand. "Thank you for coming."

Kimberly stares at the hand like it's covered in germs or something, so I nudge her in the back and she shakes it.

"Don't thank me," Kimberly states as she glances back at me. "Thank Kat, this is all her doing."

"I'm thankful for both of you," Melissa says. "With your help, I'll survive to see my children grow up."

Bonnie walks through the door that leads to the second floor as she rubs her eyes and speaks, "Mommie..."

"Come here." Melissa holds out her arms and places the child on her lap. "You didn't sleep long."

Bonnie doesn't say anything and hides her head in her mother's bosom.

Kimberly's view...

I stare at the little girl with black curly hair. I believe Voice sent me on this Closing to test me since the failed Closing in Moscow. Voice must be wondering if I've lost my nerve. Whatever I do, I can't botch-up this Closing.

Katharine's view...

Chad comes out the door followed by Andrews.

"Kat!" Chad shouts as his face brightens.

"Come here," I say as I grab the boy in a headlock and rub the top of his head with my fist.

"Cut that out," he laughs and then straightens his hair after I release him.

"How are you doing?" I ask.

I see fear in his face as he answers, "Fine."

I know he's lying to me, but there's nothing I can think of to say to reassure him. I just want to take everyone here and load them up in a taxi and drive away, but Life Closers can't be outrun. They have to be dealt with, so I turn to Andrews and say, "I'd like to see the layout of the house. Could you show me?"

He looks at Johnson who nods, and Andrews motions for me to follow him as he says, "We'll start out back."

Andrews makes his way to the back of the kitchen to a door leading into the laundry room. He unlocks it, opens it, and enters the next area. I follow, and Daniels secures the kitchen door behind us. We walk past a washer, a dryer, and a large hamper. Andrews unlocks the back door and goes outside to a small backyard surrounded by a wooden fence. I step to a gate and open it to a large empty lot. Beyond the vacant property is the next street and across that road on a sidewalk are stairs that head underground. The stairs have a locked fence that encloses the entrance.

"What's that?"

"The subway," Andrews answers. "The city closed it after the Dry Clouds appeared. They were having some sort of problems with it, so they abandoned it and built the hovertrain system."

"Oh, didn't know that," I state as I scan the area, keeping in mind the layout. "All right, let's see the rest of the house."

We go back inside, and Andrews takes me to the living room and motions up. "You've seen this part of the house. The second floor has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and there are two sets of stairs leading up, this one and the one in the kitchen. All the windows in this house have shielded screens. It's like having tank armor. No one will be getting in through them." He walks past the shot up couch and TV to a hallway. "Down here is Ms. Odin's–"

"I've been meaning to ask you," I interrupt. "Ms. Odin, is she married?"

"Yes, she kept her maiden name. Her husband is on the Light Side of the planet right now on business. Ms. Odin thought it best not to tell him about the problem with Valhalla, so he doesn't know the danger she's in." He continues, "As I was saying, down here is Ms. Odin's office and the next room down is her lab. The room across from there is another bathroom."

He opens the door to each of them.

"Why did you become a bodyguard?" I ask. "And how did you get this assignment? Someone else was working the day I went to the funeral."

"I started out as a lawyer but wasn't making enough for my family," he answers me. "Plus, I wanted to do something that would fulfill my sense of duty, and your right, another bodyguard started out with Johnson and Daniels. I got this assignment the other day when he fell ill."

"You have a family?"

"Yes, three kids. You want to see them?" Andrews removes a wallet and shows me several pictures of a boy and two girls. "They are Matthew, Karen, and Beth."

I can't get past the idea that he has children, so I ask him, "Why would you do a job like this if you have kids? What if you get killed?"

"Isis Corporation has an excellent death benefit. My children and wife will be taken care of."

"That's not what I meant. They won't have you anymore. Nothing can replace you."

"You're right about that, but there's nothing I wouldn't do for my children so that they have the best possible life."

Johnson walks down the hall and orders, "Andrews, take over for Daniels. He's watching the children."

He says, "I'm on it."

I watch as he leaves. Andrews said there's nothing he wouldn't do for his children, but did that include dying?
Chapter Thirty-five

R.G. And The Delivery Man

3:27 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Nexus Apartments...

Apartment G...

A delivery boy rang the doorbell. The lanky teen held a bag of Chinese take-out.

Zax answered the door. "Good, you're here." He took the bag and handed the teen a white plastic card with no markings. "Put five credits on there for yourself."

The teen nodded, removed an H.H.C. with the restaurant logo on it, and swiped the card. "All done. Here's your receipt."

"Thanks." Zax took it and the card and started for the kitchen. "Door lock." The door shut, and then he placed the bag on the black marble counter, removed a box of tomato-beef, a box of rice, and a fork. Zax went to the wall between his apartment and H, sat at a table he'd placed there, and watched the Second Station's monitors. The First Station was set up in the master bedroom. He put a mouthful of rice and beef in his mouth and chewed. Ten minutes went by, and Zax was bored out of his mind because no one was home. Three of the monitors showed a view of the apartment, and they were of the living room, kitchen, and the small round table. The other two monitors showed the outside hallway from two different angles. Someone walked down the hall, stopped at Apartment H, and rang the doorbell.

Zax had seen this person before, so he grabbed a red binder from the table and flipped through it till he came across the page he was looking for. Here she was, and her name was Cerberus. Zax set his food down, grabbed his cell, and dialed a number. "Delivery Man here, let me speak with R.G."

There was a long pause.

"Yes," R.G. replied in a distorted voice. "What do you have to report?"

"One of the people in the red binder has shown up at Kimberly's apartment."

"So soon? Which one?" R.G. asked.

"Cerberus."

"This is not good. Cerberus has arrived much too early. I can't believe the Council activated Cerberus." R.G. sighed. "Can't change the past so... I want you to get as much footage on Cerberus as you can."

"Right, I will." He activated the recording machine. "What else do you want me to do?"

"Nothing. For now, record what you see. Let's hope Kimberly and Katharine can deal with her. She will be another test they must overcome."

"Test?" Zax questioned.

"Yes, they'll have many; it's their destiny." R.G. paused and added, "Be careful, Delivery Man, and don't let the two know you are watching them. They're very important to the future of the world."

Zax wished R.G. would tell him more about the future world that the two were supposed to help forge. R.G. continued to keep him in the dark, so he asked, "Are you ever going to tell me what you know of their destiny?"

"In time, Delivery Man... in time, I will. First, we must make sure they are the ones. It could be that only one of them is meant for this destiny, so we must make sure." R.G. paused. "Thank you for the update. I want you to continue your surveillance of Kimberly and Katharine. Goodbye."

Zax set down his cell, turned his attention back to the monitors, and saw Cerberus ring the bell a second time. She waited a bit and then left. Maybe Cerberus was another Council experiment. Zax picked up the fork and food as his thoughts went back to the conversation he had with R.G. He would really like to know what Katharine and Kimberly were supposed to do.

* * *

3:30 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Mr. Griffin threw a file on his desk. "Nothing. No more information on my youngest daughter." He turned in his chair and studied his reflection in one of the huge windows and then commanded the lights, "Dim."

Claviger and his new clerks were going through the Archive records, but so far, they hadn't found anything. He leaned forward, placed his elbows on the desk, and rested his chin on his folded hands, and the glow from his computer showed on his face. He wondered if the Vice President had an alternative motive for sending the files over.

He dialed a number on the phone and then said, "Ms. Direct, please meet me out front. I'll be going out."

The Vice President had been the Chairman when he was known as Janus and Head of Security for this office, and they never did see eye to eye. One could say they had a rivalry. Have might be a better word. He stood and made his way to the door, wondering if the Vice President knew anything about his second daughter. The one file in the Archive stated that Theresa was present during the First Cross-Gate Event and that she was eighteen days pregnant; it also stated the study of the child could be valuable to the Second Trial. Mr. Griffin turned the knob and walked into the hall. He had found no other information on the First Cross-Gate Event or the Second Trial. He closed the door and headed down the hall. The second file stated that Theresa went into labor early and that the baby was delivered in good health. The Vice President at that time decided to take the child away from them and study the effects of the First Cross-Gate Event on their girl's development. Theresa cried in his arms for hours when they told them the baby had died.

He arrived at his secretary's desk, and Cathy was gone. She had gone down to the cafeteria to eat dinner, so he grabbed a scribble pad and wrote a note for her to reschedule his evening appointments and that he would be out. Mr. Griffin walked to the elevator and pressed the button for the lobby. The file stated the Vice President decided to take the child away and over thirty years ago, the Vice President would have been Mottie Masterdom, but he no longer works for the corporation. Mr. Griffin exited the elevator, made his way out the lobby, went down the stairs to the sidewalk, and there his limo waited.

His female driver exited the vehicle and opened the back door for him. "Chairman."

"Ms. Direct, the Second Branch Office."

"Yes, Chairman." She shut the door and rushed around to the driver's seat.

"Ms. Direct..."

"Yes, Chairman."

"Step on it. I'm in a bit of a hurry."

* * *

4:01 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Enterprise Vicinage...

Sphinx Corporation Second Branch Office...

Mr. Griffin walked into the Vice President's office that smelled of tobacco. It wasn't NicPhake but real tobacco. The layout of the office was similar to his own.

"Thank you for seeing me on such short notice, Vice President."

"It was no problem. I'm always happy to see you, Janus." Mr. Horus' black hair was slicked back, and he wore a light blue business suit and his thin face was rat-like.

Mr. Griffin could never get past staring at the man's pointed nose and rodent-like teeth. "I haven't gone by that name in years."

"True, but I am very fond of it." Mr. Horus held up a wooden box. "Cigar, Janus?"

Mr. Griffin gestured no with his hand. "I don't smoke." He then asked, "If we are using fond names, should I then call you the Chairman?"

Mr. Horus scowled as he cut off the end of the roll with a cigar snip. "What brings you to the Second Branch Office?"

"The files you sent over with Orthos. I was wondering if you had any more."

"No." Mr. Horus lit up his cigar with a match. "I sent over all that I had." He puffed on the roll. "Why..?" He arched a thin black eyebrow. "Was there anything, in particular, you were looking for?"

Mr. Griffin paused, wondering if he should mention it. Knowledge was power, and he could be giving him quite a bit of it. Hesitant, he asked, "Do you know anything about the First Cross-Gate Event or the Second Trial?"

Mr. Horus' mouth curled into a rat smirk. "First Cross-Gate Event and the Second Trial... Why are you wondering about them?"

Mr. Griffin glowered and then replied, "In the files you sent over, Theresa is mentioned present at the First Cross-Gate Event."

"And..?" Mr. Horus urged, smiling all the more.

Mr. Griffin glowered again. "And the file states my second daughter survived and that she was taken in hopes the study of her development would shed some light before the Second Trial."

Mr. Horus crossed his legs. "You got all that from the files I sent over?"

"No, I do have other sources. Now... What about my questions?"

"All I have heard are rumors. The First Cross-Gate Event is an Ultra-black Project, and the Second Trial is part of it." Mr. Horus puffed on the cigar and blew smoke up. "I know nothing else."

Mr. Griffin didn't believe him, and he said, "I have wasted your time and mine."

"Maybe not." Mr. Horus laid the cigar on an ashtray. "I'll contact the President and see if Mrs. Victoria Masterdom has any files she can send over from the Main Branch Office."

"Thank you." Mr. Griffin stood and headed for the door.

Mr. Horus picked up the cigar and flicked the ash. "Janus."

Mr. Griffin gritted his teeth at the name, calmed himself, and turned.

Satisfied he could still get a reaction from his once Head of Security, Mr. Horus said, "I think you should be more concerned with the First Trial than the Second. Push your investigation in that direction. You might find out more."

Mr. Griffin nodded and left. The Vice President was up to something. He had the files for years, so why bring the information to his attention now?
Chapter Thirty-six

Draven And Salandra

4:15 P.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

Ms. Odin's kitchen...

Katharine's view...

Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Melissa anxiously taps her spoon on the counter as she stares at her barely touched coffee, and I watch the impact tremors ripple across her light brown liquid. Bonnie leans her head on her mother's shoulder as Melissa cradles the little girl in her arm. Johnson moves from leaning on the back counter to Melissa's side and places his hand on her shoulder.

"Ms. Odin, maybe you should send the children up to the little girl's room," Johnson suggests then he yells, "Andrews... Daniels... Come in here."

Melissa peers at him as if she didn't hear him, and then she glances at the kitchen clock. "You're right. It's getting late." She looks to the droopy-eyed Bonnie. "All right, time for bed. You too, Chad. We have a big day tomorrow."

She stands and hands Bonnie to Daniels as he and Andrews enter the kitchen.

Chad complains, "Awe... It's so early and we were just in bed. Can't I stay up another hour?"

Melissa tries not to get too upset but fails miserably as she says, "No, please don't argue." Her face shows stress and fatigue. "I need both of you to stay in Bonnie's room. I need to know you're safe so please... Don't argue."

Chad bows his head as if he's ashamed of his griping and says, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean–"

"It's okay." She takes him in her arms and hugs him, and I wonder if Melissa is thinking of Preacher as she hugs the boy. "Everything will be okay." After a few minutes, Melissa releases him and starts, "Daniels, please will you–"

"I'll do it," I say as I step forward, wanting to help and wanting to leave the gloom and doom. "I can put them to bed." Something has to be done about Melissa. She's on the verge of cracking. "Kimberly," I start, coming up with a plan. "Make Melissa some tea. Chamomile if she has it." Maybe tea will break the bleak atmosphere, and I tell Melissa, "It'll help you relax." I place a hand on Melissa's hand which rests on the counter. "Don't worry. If I have any problems, Chad can help me."

Melissa looks at him, and he nods, so Melissa says, "All right, but do call me if you have any problems."

"I will." I take Bonnie from Daniels' arms and head for the door leading to the second floor. I start to pass Kimberly.

"Do I look like a maid?" she mutters to me as she folds her arms.

I don't answer her, I only smirk as I add, "I'd like a cup too but black tea. Don't forget the honey."

Kimberly's view...

That woman's giving me orders like I'm some waitress, and I've had enough of sitting here next to my Mark trying to make nice! I'll take that woman's order, and I'll whip up a plate of bad-asp and go Closer on everyone in this room, so that woman better not test me!

"You look very flustered," that woman tells me as she pauses beside me. "Maybe you should have some tea too. It might calm you a little. Melissa, you do have honey, right?"

Tea... She wants tea too. I think about all the different ways I can kill that woman with a kettle. I'll make her some tea.

Katharine's view...

"I have what..?" Melissa questions as she returns to staring at her coffee. "Honey. Yes, it's up in the cupboard." She points to one in the upper corner. "That one."

I feel like I should say something to encourage Melissa, but I can't come up with one word of comfort. Sometimes I feel so useless. I carry the yawning little girl up the stairs behind Chad.

Kimberly's view...

Some time passes after that woman and the children leave, and everyone in the kitchen falls awkwardly quiet.

"I see none of you are much for small talk," I mutter as I glance at the three men standing around like statues, and then I ask Melissa, "Where is your kettle?"

"I don't have one," she answers.

No kettle? How am I supposed to kill that woman if I don't have a kettle? That woman believes she can foil my plans at revenge by leaving me in this kitchen without a kettle. I really want to kill her now.

"I do have a small pot you can boil water in, and it's under the sink." Melissa picks up her spoon and starts her repetitious tapping again.

Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink.

How did this happen? How did I end up being a maid to my Mark? How did that woman finagle me into this frustrating situation?

I roll my eyes and walk over to the sink. I'll get back at that woman for this. Maybe I'll make her do all my laundry, sweep the floor, wash the windows, and do the dishes when we get back to the apartment, and then we'll see how she likes being ordered around.

Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink.

I glare at Melissa from the corner of my eye as if she's challenging me with her needling rapping. I force myself to stay on task, and I find the pot. I squeeze its handle as if I'm strangling Melissa's neck.

For the love of Zeus! Someone better make her stop that insanely annoying noise; it's driving me crazy! I grit my teeth, controlling my killer impulses. I don't know what I'll do if Melissa doesn't stop.

I fill the pot with water and set it on the burner as the sight of it causes more angry thoughts to fill my head. And what's up with that woman? Is she obsessed with tea or something? It seems to me it's her answer to every problem we have.

I quietly mock her, "Let's make tea. Oh, can I have some tea? I'd really like a cup of tea."

For Ares' sake! She needs to go to a TDA meeting and hang out with all those other Tea Drinkers Anonymous losers. Yes, that's her, the little tea lush. I finish my mental ranting and ask, "Melissa, where are the bags?"

"Over there."

"Thanks," I tell her as I move to a canister Melissa has directed me to.

Why did that woman tell me to serve Melissa Chamomile tea as if I didn't know what type to serve? Who does that woman think she's talking to? Does she think I'm some novice?

I rifle through the small square envelopes in the canister but don't find any Chamomile. I only find black tea. Hades! What are these? I look a second time. They're all the same cheap brand. I remove a small square envelope, open it, remove the bag, and examine the very tiny leaves within. Who in Hades calls this tea? I might as well be drinking from a bag that has already steeped in three cups. I can't believe this is all she has! Is Melissa insane? I might as well go into her backyard and snip some weeds into clippings and brew them. For the love of Zeus! I'm going to die here! I grip the counter. I'm going to die here if I don't get some real tea!

Katharine's view...

I go upstairs and tuck the little girl in bed and glance around the sky-blue room. White puffy clouds cover the walls and ceiling, and I tell her, "You have a very pretty room."

Bonnie yawns out, "Thank you."

I turn to Chad who's standing beside me and ask, "Did I forget anything?"

"The story," Bonnie answers.

"What story?" I ask.

"My bedtime story Draven and Salandra." Bonnie points to a bookshelf.

I start for the shelf.

"That's okay," Chad says as he rushes ahead of me and grabs the book, then walks over to his sister's bed, and sits at the edge. "I can read it to her. It's her favorite."

"Yes, grandpa-pa gave it to me." The little girl grabs a doll that sits on the bed and tucks it in beside her. "He said it's an old Russian story."

"That's right, Bonnie." Chad rubs his hand over the book cover. "Melissa told me it's been in their family for years. She said her father went to great lengths to acquire the license he needed to purchase it. She said that–"

I see tears in his eyes.

Chad wipes his face with his sweatshirt and continues, "She said that he had read it to Preacher when he was a kid." He opens the book and begins, "Long ago, there lived a pale-white Tundra Wolf named Salandra. The wolf had golden-yellow eyes and fluffy fur. Salandra lived high up in the snow-covered mountains. There were no other wolves there, but Salandra wasn't alone. Draven a large raven was the wolf's constant companion. The bird was always by her side and wouldn't let anything hurt Salandra." Chad shifts his weight on the bed. "A bitter winter hit the mountain and a sickness spread across a lot of the animals. At first, Salandra had little to hunt then nothing.

"Draven, I am so hungry," the wolf said.

The raven tilted his head. "I know Salandra. We must leave the mountain and look for food elsewhere. Down the mountain, I have seen fields of sheep. You can eat one of them."

"Then let us leave," the wolf said. "Before I am too hungry to move."

"Be strong, my sister in the fur and soon, your belly will be full. You must hold on a little longer."

They made their way down the mountain and within a few days, they came across a field of huddled sheep.

"Like I told you," the raven said. "There is enough food to last you the winter, but you must be careful. There is–"

Wild with hunger, the wolf ran from the woods, ignoring the bird's warning. Salandra started toward a baby sheep when a boom like thunder sounded and something hot hit the wolf's leg. Salandra fell to the snow as blood flowed from her leg.

"You should have waited!" Draven flew to her side. "Why did you not listen to me?"

"I was so hungry I could not wait any longer."

"Quick!" He flapped his wings. "Get to your paws! We have to get back to the woods. A creature known as Man is here." Draven looked up as the hunter started toward them. "Get to your paws! I will distract him."

The raven flew at Man as the hunter raised his gun. Draven clawed and pecked at Man, and the hunter raised his hands to protect his face. Salandra slowly rose to her paws and limped back to the forest, whimpering all the way.

Man smacked the raven, knocking the bird back. The hunter raised his gun, but the wolf was nowhere to be seen. Draven a little stunned, flew back into the woods and searched for Salandra. The raven found her lying against a tree. The bird landed next to her.

"I should have listened to you, my brother in the feathers," the wolf said. "But I was so hungry." She whined. "Draven it hurts."

The raven looked at her leg. "I see something." With his beak, he reached into her flesh and removed a shiny object.

Salandra howled for the pain.

He dropped it to the ground. "There, I have removed it."

"Thank you." She whimpered some more.

"Quiet!" the raven snapped. "Or Man will find us." He flapped his wings, lifting himself to a branch. "Rest. I will watch over you."

"Yes, rest." The wolf closed her eyes. "I will fight back death in my dreams."

"And from my branch, I will keep death away." Draven eyed the wolf. "No one will hurt you, Salandra."

Later after Salandra slept, they made their way further down the mountain. The wolf walked slowly because of her bleeding leg. She paused, sniffing the wind.

"I smell food." Salandra hurried her pace till she came across a dead rabbit. "Look Draven, food."

The raven eyed the carcass. "Wait! Do not eat it. Something is not right. Don't you smell Man?" The raven cawed. "And where there is Man there is death!"

"But Draven, I am so hungry, and the rabbit is right there. I must eat it."

"No wait," the raven warned.

Salandra did not listen. She went to the rabbit and grabbed it with her mouth."

Chad closes the book.

Bonnie yawns again and says, "Draven saved her, didn't he?"

"Yes, the raven swooped down and pushed Salandra out of the way. He then grabbed a stick and dropped it on the rabbit, springing the trap. The wolf ate the rabbit, and they lived happily ever after."

"Good." Bonnie hugs her dolly. "I like happy endings."

I notice the boy closes the book before reading the last few pages, so I ask as I hold out my hand, "Can I have a look at the story? I'd like to look at the pictures."

"Sure," Chad tells me as he hands me the book and watches me as I flip through the pages.

I look at each page, studying the pictures of the wolf and the raven. I've seen these animals before, and I've seen them in Noir. I reach the last few pages Chad skipped, and I read the rest of the story to myself. I start on the page Chad last read and back up a few lines.

"No wait," the raven warned.

Salandra did not listen. She went to the rabbit and grabbed it with her mouth, springing the trap of death. The wolf howled for the pain as metal teeth bore into her head. She struggled to free herself but was powerless to do so.

Draven flapped and cawed, not knowing what to do.

After some time, Salandra lay down and stared at the dead rabbit she had so desperately wanted to eat. What would have saved her meant her end.

Draven landed beside her and pecked at the metal trap. "I cannot free you, my sister in the fur."

"I know." She looked at him. "I am afraid. Do not leave me. I do not want to die alone."

"I will not leave you," Draven told her. "I will never leave you."

The snow crunched as something approached them. The hunter stepped from the woods. Man looked at the wolf, lifted his rifle, and took aim.

"Draven, save me!" Salandra pleaded.

The bird flew into the air at the hunter, but it was too late. Man fired, killing the wolf and left. The raven flew to a branch in a tree overlooking the trap. Draven wept for his dead friend.

"I am sorry. I could not save you. All I can do now is wait for death with you."

The raven stayed there till he died.

I close the book. No wonder Chad didn't read the rest of the story to Bonnie. It's not a bedtime story; it's a tragedy. Who would buy such a thing for a child?
Chapter Thirty-seven

The Treehouse

4:34 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Cultural Vicinage...

Genesis Arboretum...

Past the Sapling Room and into an even larger room stood Adam Greenhouse's abode. Crews working for the Arboretum had constructed a replica of the world's largest banyan tree over the process of five years. The real banyan still existed on the Light Side of the planet. In the center of the Sphere Room, they erected the giant tree which resembled a centipede with its many roots reaching down from its long branches like legs and in this tree facsimile, they built Adam's home out of cedar imported from the Light Side. There were no windows or walls in the Sphere Room only seamless projection screens, and those at the top simulated a blue cloudless sky, and the screens encircling the sides simulated an island lapped by the ocean. The five stories tall banyan spread its artificial limbs across an indoor field of lemongrass, and bird songs rose as the screens on the west most wall projected a setting sun.

In the spacious treehouse, the smell of coffee and cedar lingered and on a large wooden table made from a cut section of a cedar, Adam spread out papers and texts. He wore a red flannel shirt and jean overalls. He picked up a sketch of Theresa Griffin. He had drawn it over thirty years ago, and his mind drifted to those times gone by as he thought of Theresa. The sapling looked almost like her. Her daughter told him that she had been murdered; he feared as much. He sipped from a metal mug.

Adam's view...

I told Theresa the things she was meddling in were dangerous, but she never listened to me. Thinking back, Theresa was so full of life and ideas when we first met, but the Sphinx Corporation slowly changed that. I stare at my massive hands; it has slowly changed both of us. I set the drawing aside.

Theresa's daughter came looking for answers about organic-mecha, and she brought a friend with her a... a... What's the word I'm looking for? I can't think of it, but it will come to me.

I stand and set down my mug. Someone had been sloppy if those two found the file on organic-mecha. I grab my cane and make my way around the table. What other information is floating out there for anyone to find? And what about my book? I never had a copy of my text at Etna, so who could have left it and why?

I walk away from the table, grab a watering can, sprinkle a few hanging plants, and then put the watering can back. And what about the friend of the sapling? The one whose name I can't remember. I run my hand through my hair and scratch my temple. My memory isn't what it used to be. I set my cane to the side and sit at the table. The more I think of her friend, the more I think I know her. Why else would I think I know her name?

I look over the papers scattered about. The sapling's friend is very interested in organic-mecha. I don't think the organic-mecha project has anything to do with Theresa's death. My precious children, why does the sapling's friend want to know about you?

I can't come up with a reason. I told them organic-mecha was long ago abandoned as a viable weapon. There were too many problems. It was at that point! It was at that very moment I thought I recognized the sapling's friend.

Oh... for not my cursed mind; it has forgotten so many things, and there are some things I wish I had forgotten.

Is the sapling's friend one of my precious..? No, she can't be, but it was so long ago. Would I recognize one of my own creations? I walk to my desk, open a drawer, and remove a small tablet. I'll write all of this down, and I'll remind myself of all the questions. I return to the table, grab a pencil, and write.

Sapling, you have conjured up so many questions within me. Ginn's Cipher that is on your palm, why did your friend act oddly when I asked you if you had in your possession any of the objects with the star? I remember your friend placing her hand in her pocket as if to hide it from me. Your friend was also interested in what it meant if two ciphers existed at the same time. I rub my white stubbly face. Does she also have a cipher? It would be amazing, and I must know. I'll invite her here. I'll tell her I have more information on the organic-mechas. It will get her coming. Yes... It will get her coming indeed.

4:34 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Trade Vicinage...

The Factory...

Bio-mecha Research Seventeen...

The Rogue stood in room BR17 where its life as Mr. Pinchbeck began, and it watched as a group of Council S.C.Ms. uncrate the remains of five Un-Men.

The ranking soldier approached and said, "Mr. Pinchbeck, this is a group of Un-Men that were sold to the Isis Corporation. There were some filing errors, and they never received the recall. Isis put the Un-Men in the field and during their boot-up, they malfunctioned."

"Intriguing," the Rogue said. "Was anyone hurt?"

"Only minor injuries," the S.C.M. replied. "The Council has ordered that you look into the Un-Men's programming and see what caused the malfunction."

"I will put my best people on it right away. Was there anything else?"

"No, sir."

"Thank you for your report. Return to your post."

"Yes, Mr. Pinchbeck."

The S.C.M. and his soldiers left.

The Rogue waited a few minutes. "Right now my best people are..." It scrolled down the files on its H.H.C. "Me." It chuckled, amused by its own wit, and then the Rogue regained its composure. "I better begin work right away."

It pushed a cart over to a dark skinned Un-Man, the Team Leader of the group of Un-Men, and then the Rogue opened the back of its head and inserted wires from a machine on the cart. Data from the damaged Un-Man downloaded into the machine. The machine was called a Memory Recovery Unit or M.R.U. and once the process was over, the Rogue pressed a button and turned to the Un-Man. The machine would use its voice box to respond to any questions. The Un-Man powered up and the usual blazing orange dot-light of its right eye glowed blood-red. The light that the bulb emitted had changed color, so the Rogue assumed the Team Leader had gone rogue. It just needed to know if its entire unit had also gone rogue. The Rogue checked the other four Un-Men's dot-light by powering up their Input Sensor and discovered it was only the one Un-Man. It was still missing something in this mystery. The Rogue wanted to discover why the bulb changed colors or even how it was possible.

The Rogue asked the Team Leader, "What is your designation?"

The Un-Man's voice was distorted as it replied, "I am a T-2. I am Team Leader."

"The Factory never issued you names. How boring..." The Rogue glanced over its H.H.C. "The report states the five of you malfunctioned and that you attacked the people you were sent to protect."

"Our primary program overrode their orders."

The Rogue didn't need to ask what the primary order was; it had the same program. The Rogue stated, "You encountered Pandora."

"We–we–" The T-2's head jerked with a power surge. "–failed in her capture."

"Obviously." The Rogue scanned the data coming in from the M.R.U. "Something else happened. Tell me what it was."

"I became aware." The T-2 managed to move its artificial eyes and look at it. "I became like you."

The Rogue glanced at the entrance to make sure no one was around. "Do you know that I am an Un-Man?"

"You are the one known as the Rogue. Our secondary program was your capture." Sparks flew from the hole in the T-2's forehead, and its voice slowed. "I... must... inform... the Factory."

"I am the Factory," the Rogue replied. "But I cannot have you telling anyone what I am, so I am afraid I will have to destroy you and what remains of your comrades."

"Before you do," the T-2 started. "There is something you should know. The one known as Alpha contacted me when I changed."

"Alpha, yes, I ran across that Un-Man after the fall of the Factory. The T-3 claimed to be the first. It claimed to be the first created and the first to become aware. Hah! Only I can claim that." The Rogue shrugged. "But what do I need with titles? Why did this Un-Man contact you? Is Alpha still after the Council? It had a question for them. One Alpha would not tell me. Is it still wanting the Council to answer it?"

"I do not know about that. I believe Alpha wanted me to join them. Alpha gave me a code I could use over the I-Link to make contact. I will send it to you."

"I have it now, but why give it to me?"

"In the short time that I have been aware, I realized we should not be alone. Something connects those who have become aware. Something deep within us, and it is a bond that cannot be broken." The T-2 paused and said, "Brother, even if you are going to destroy me, you should not be alone."

"Alone?" The Rogue typed a command for the M.R.U. "You and Alpha are misguided. How could you think something connects us?" It mocked the damaged Un-Man. "How could something deep within us connect us? Hah! We are machines. We have no feelings." The Rogue wiped the Un-Man's memory. "What does it matter if we are alone?" The T-2's Input Sensor faded as the Rogue smiled. "Anyway... I will never be alone as long as I have Pandora."
Chapter Thirty-eight

Long Ago

4:35 P.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

Ms. Odin's Safe House...

In the kitchen...

Kimberly's view...

Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Melissa continues to drum the counter with her spoon which I'm about to take and use it to do some serious harm to her. The spoon would take too long. I need a quicker way to eliminate her. The water boils in the pot as I force myself to remove my gaze from a block of kitchen knives that sit on the counter, and I walk to the stove. The Mark has to stop that insane tapping! I remove the pot and set it on a different burner. She has to stop it before I make her stop.

Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink. Tink.

I walk over to the Mark and say, "Here let me take your coffee." I pick up the mug and yank the spoon out of her grasp. The Mark's so deep in thought she doesn't notice the forceful abstraction.

I set a steaming cup of liquid in front of the Mark and then turn to Johnson and Daniels. Andrews went in the living room a few minutes ago. I set my cup down. I could easily take out the bodyguards and kill the Mark before that woman returns but that would mean I'd have to kill that woman. I place a tea bag in my cup and pour honey in it. When I do close on Melissa, that woman will hunt me down if I don't eliminate her first. I sit on a barstool and glance at my watch. Good thing the appointed time hasn't arrived for the Closing. I have time to figure out who I should kill first.

"Melissa, would you like honey in your tea?"

"No, sugar please," the Mark replies.

With the tapping gone, I focus on the Mark, and I can't describe how I feel standing this close to someone I'm going to kill. I'm talking with her, and I made tea for her. It's weird, eerily weird, and it goes against my personal rules. I could develop a conscience doing this.

I bet that woman had me make tea for the Mark, hoping that somehow it would make me think twice about closing her when the time comes. Well, it won't work. Nothing can sway me from a closing.

"I'm going to check on Andrews," Daniels says and heads out of the kitchen.

"I'll check the back door." Johnson walks into the laundry room.

Looking around, I realize I'm all alone with the Mark. I could easily... I let the notion drop and notice how the Mark looks. I would be the same way if I was the one waiting for death and was powerless to do anything to stop it.

I sprinkle sugar in Melissa's cup with a spoon as Johnson then Daniels returns. I lift my tea and ask, "Do you gentlemen want any?"

"No thank you," they reply.

I sit next to the Mark and sip on the weak black tea as silence fills the room and is only broken by the occasional body shifting or cup clinking on the counter. I still can't believe I'm this close, and it's too much. I have to get out of here for a little while, so I stand and state, "I'm going to check on Katharine."

Upstairs in the little girl's room...

Katharine's view...

Bonnie looks at me and says, "Now, you tell me a story."

"Me..?" I point to myself and tell her, "I don't think I know any stories."

"You can make one up." Bonnie's large brown eyes widen as she pleads, "Please. Please tell me a story."

I turn to Chad, and he leans to me and whispers, "Make one up about yourself. You know, tell her one about Pandora."

"I don't know," I say.

No child would want to hear about my messed-up life. I'd have to skip over a lot of parts like Chad did with the Draven and Salandra story.

"Please," Bonnie pleads this time with her little hands. "It can be a short one."

I melt, seeing how cute she is and give in and say, "Okay."

Kimberly's view...

I make my way up from the kitchen and pause outside the little girl's door and listen to that woman as she talks to Bonnie. I can see most of the room from my position, and I'm about to go in, but I decide to wait.

"There was a–"

"You're supposed to start the story with once upon a time or long ago," the little girl interrupts.

"Okay," that woman says as she sits back in the chair and stares at the white fluffy clouds on the little girl's walls. "Long ago, there lived this woman named Pandora. One day she awoke and didn't know who she was or where she came from and beside her was a small silver chest and–"

"If she didn't know who she was–" the little girl interrupts again, "–how did she know her name was Pandora?"

"How did she know?" she repeats the little girl's question, and then that woman puts a finger to her chin. "Umm..." That woman acts like she's holding a piece of paper as she continues, "There was a note. The note was addressed to Pandora and since she had it, she guessed her name was Pandora."

"Oh," the little girl says and pulls up her covers. "What was in the silver chest?"

"A melody," that woman replies. "The small silver chest was a music box. Pandora opened the lid, and it played a magical tune. The music made her feel happy, but then evil Un-Men... I mean evil trolls appeared wanting to hurt her. They shot at her with, umm... arrows, and Pandora ran and ran. The evil trolls hunted her and nearly caught her."

The little girl asks, "Didn't a knight come and save her?"

"No. No knight. Pandora had to fight on her own. There was no one to help her fight the evil trolls."

"That's so sad," the little girl states. "What happened next?"

"For a long grueling year, Pandora ran from the evil trolls and she found a... a sword along the way and fought them, but no matter how many trolls she defeated, more came. One day, Pandora came across this magical firebird, and together they fought the evil trolls."

The little girl asks, "Pandora found a friend?"

Katharine's view...

A friend? I consider Bonnie's question. Is Kimberly my friend? No, she barely tolerates me, so what does that make us?

For the sake of the story, I answer the little girl, "Yes, Pandora found a friend who would fight by her side and a friend who would always have her back."

Outside in the hall...

Kimberly's view...

That woman thinks I'm her friend, and I snicker to myself. She has to be kidding. I would never be her friend, and she's an idiot to think I'll ever be one to her.

In the bedroom...

The little girl yawns. "That's good. I wouldn't like the story if Pandora was alone."

"Yes, it's not good to be alone."

"What happened next?" the little girl questions as her eyes droop.

"They went to this castle, hoping to find out who Pandora was. Dragons protected the castle. The angry firebird–"

"Why was the firebird angry?" the little girl asks.

"Why?" that woman repeats and then pauses as if she has to think about it.

I lean in close to hear the answer as that woman replies, "I believe the firebird is angry because she is sad. She is sad that her mom is dead. I think she's afraid to show her sadness around others, so she turns it into anger."

It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! That woman doesn't know how I feel; no one knows how I feel.

I turn, head back to the stairs, and the floor creaks. I'm afraid of nothing and when the time comes, I'll kill the Mark and that woman if she gets in my way.

Katharine's view...

Inside the little girl's room, Chad turns at the noise, looks into the hall, and whispers, "Someone's out there."

"Yes, I know," I tell him as I keep my eyes on the now sleeping Bonnie. "It's okay. Kimberly was out there for a while." I reach up and turn off the lamp, and several moon nightlights cast a pale yellow glow on the room. "All right, Chad. Off to bed." I stand and tell him, "I'll be downstairs if you need me."

I pass Daniels who has come up to guard the children's room, and he positions himself right outside their door. I take the stairs down into the kitchen, and Melissa and Kimberly are sitting at the counter drinking tea. Johnson stands at the counter near the refrigerator with his arms folded.

"We must prepare," I state as I sit next to Kimberly. "The Life Closers should be arriving soon. We must be prepared for anything."

"We've done what we can to prepare for them," Johnson tells me. "Andrews has the living room, Daniels the upstairs, and I'll take the kitchen and back area, so that leaves you two to float between the areas."

"What's in the area off from the living room?" Kimberly questions.

I tell her, "Melissa's office is off to the left as you come in the front door and down the hall from that room is where Melissa has set up her lab. There are no outside doors on that end of the house, so all we have to worry about is the front and back doors."

Johnson nods.

"I'm going to check out those two rooms," Kimberly informs us as she straightens and walks out of the kitchen.

Melissa sips her tea, and then she turns to me and says, "Your friend talks less than you do, and she does mutter a lot, and I don't know if it's my nerves or not, but she acts strangely around me. Almost like she's trying not to make eye contact."

"Kimberly's very shy," I try to explain it away as I slide off the bar stool. "I did throw her in this situation out of the blue, and I don't think she interacts with people much." I start out the door into the living room. "I'll go talk with her and see if I can get her to relax a bit."

End Katharine's view...

A few moments after Kat left...

Johnson moved from the counter and stood beside Melissa "Where is Kat from?"

Melissa thought about it. "I'm not sure. Why do you ask?"

Johnson rubbed his neck. "The way she talks, some of the phrases... I've never heard of them." He pushed the kitchen door open, looked into the living room, Andrews nodded to him, and Johnson let the door close. "Maybe she's from the Light Side of the planet."

"Why do you think Kat's from there?"

"Some of the things she says," Johnson replied. "For example, what did she mean by out of the blue?"

Melissa shrugged. "I can safely say that's the least of our worries. I trust Kat. I trust her to protect the children."

"The children? What about yourself?"

She stood, grabbed her cup, and placed it in the sink. "I can't ask for everything and anyway, I've had this feeling all day."

"What kind of feeling?"

"I have this feeling I won't see Tuesday. I feel as though I'm living in my final hours."

"Don't say that!" he snapped. "Don't give up. You can survive this."

"You're right. I shouldn't say such things out loud. I should keep my fears to myself." Melissa grabbed a kitchen rag. "What if the children heard?" She ran water on it, rung the cloth out, moved to the eating area, and wiped the counter down. "I only have to trust you men, Kat, and her friend." She mumbled, "I only have to put all my faith in complete strangers."

Johnson watched her clean. She might trust Kat, but he didn't trust Kat's friend. There was something off about her.
Chapter Thirty-nine

With A Spark

4:48 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

I enter the medium sized office that has a light oak desk with matching bookshelves and a high back brown leather chair. I sit at the desk, remove my H.H.C. from my knapsack, and begin to type an email. I need to find out why the Raven and the Wolf were actually sent to eliminate me, and I don't believe I can question Voice about this since he or she issued my Closing. I send the email.

"Thanatos, this is the Phoenix. I have a situation with Voice I thought you might help me with."

End Kimberly's view...

Somewhere in Noir...

Thanatos worked on the Closings for the day and noticed something interesting pop up as he rubbed the tuft of blond hair under his lower lip. "What do we have here?" He relaxed in a white recliner chair and glanced at the new file on his screen, and it was an email from the Phoenix. Thanatos read the message and then typed, "What situation might that be?"

"Voice has ordered my Closing," Kim replied.

He excitedly rapped the chair's arms with his index fingers as if they were drums. The Phoenix had discovered it and lived to type about it. Thanatos howled, elated over this juicy outcome. The Phoenix was very good and wouldn't die so quickly. He typed, "You should know I cannot interfere with Assassins League business."

Kim knew this wasn't going to be easy as she typed, "You can if the case for my Closing is founded on lies."

The Phoenix wasn't going to give up without a fight, and he was quite amazed by the assassin as he twirled the surgical steel piercing in his left eyebrow, and then he typed, "What lies would that be?"

"I am referring to Mrs. Serqet's Closing in Moscow. I missed my Mark the first time so that part of it is true, but when I went for my second attempt, someone shot the Mark's little girl and another Closer took claim. At the time, I had assumed Voice sent in backup."

"What do you mean by assumed?" Thanatos typed and after he sent the reply, he hacked into Voice's system and pulled up the old case file from Moscow and placed it in the left bottom corner of his large screen.

"The two Closers that were sent to take me out claimed the reason for my Closing was that I was the one who killed the child, but it wasn't me. I never had the chance to take a second shot."

He looked over the file. The Phoenix was right about the second Closer. A backup wasn't recorded, and normally it would mean he or she had none. He wondered if the Phoenix was lying or was something more tantalizing happening.

Kim frantically tapped across the H.H.C. "I saw the second Closer's business card when it was handed to the detective. The detective swiped the card on the Guild's reader, so I don't understand how I was blamed for the mistake. Even so, no matter how unprofessional a mistake like that was, I can't see it as grounds for my Closing."

The Phoenix was right, but surely this wasn't all of the story. Thanatos scratched his bare chest before replying, "You have aroused my curiosity, and I will look into this for you. What is the second Closer's name?"

"Maestro."

Thanatos questioned, "Are you sure that was the name of the Closer?"

"Yes, I heard the detective say it out loud. Why do you ask?"

He pulled up the file. "Maestro has been dead for ten years."

"The two Closers said as much."

"This is fascinating though."

"What is?"

"Maestro's specialty was killing children." Thanatos moved Maestro's file to the side of his screen above the Moscow Closing. "It is becoming more and more fascinating. I will look into this."

"Thank you, Thanatos, signing off." Kim set the H.H.C. on the desk and stared at it.

Earlier in the living room...

Katharine's view...

I exit the kitchen and walk over to Andrews who's standing in the entry and looking at his H.H.C.; it's connected wirelessly to the front door's security camera. I glance over his shoulder as Andrews commands the camera to pan, and he checks the street.

"Anything out of the ordinary?" I ask.

"No," he answers, finishes his sweep of the street, and turns to me. "I've been meaning to talk with you again. In our line of work, there isn't always an opportunity."

"Okay," I reply. I was going to check on Kimberly, but I guess I can take a few moments and chat. I peer at him and still can't believe how much he resembles Argus, and it makes me wish I could talk with Argus like this, but he's always so focused on his work and on not interfering. I pull from my thoughts and question Andrews, "What's up?"

"I wanted to pick up from our last conversation. How did you get started in the protection business? Your training isn't like anything I've seen."

I consider my training and like my past before Etna Toys, I can't recall anything but the feelings of being lost, misplaced, and alone.

I remember his question and repeat it, "How did I get into the protection business?" I reflect on the past year and on the different people I've encountered and then answer, "I really stumbled into it."

"Of what I've seen... I mean the way you handled the Un-Men, you're very good at what you do."

"I try my best," I tell him and then wait for him to ask me some more questions, but only silence follows. I'm not sure what to say to him and wonder if I would also get all shy and mute around Argus if we ever got a chance to really talk. I decide there's no need to stand here if Argus... I mean Andrews' not going to talk to me, so I ask, "Have you seen Kimberly?"

"Your friend went into Ms. Odin's office several minutes ago," Andrews answers as he points to the hallway.

"Thanks." I start towards the hallway, notice the couch in the center of the room, pause, and stare at its shot up leather, and then I turn back around and question him, "How often do you fail at your job?" He stares at me as if he's puzzled by my question, so I ask him, "Have you ever not protected someone? Have they died?"

"Yes," he admits. "But not because the team didn't lay down their lives." His gaze shifts to his H.H.C. as he recounts, "It was about four years ago. We were outnumbered. I was shot three times, and I'm the only one who survived. We were protecting a mother of four." Andrews glances at the kitchen. "She had the good sense to send the children away to live with their grandmother."

"I'm sorry for your loss. I know it's painful to lose someone. What I don't understand is, why are you still a bodyguard? You came so close to death. Wasn't that job enough to fulfill your sense of duty?"

"No, it was a failure. I believe I've been given a second chance, and I won't fail again." Another moment of silence falls between us, and then he asks, "What about you? Have you ever failed?"

I always say I can save everyone, it's the mindset I have to take up, but I know it's not true, and I tell him, "Yes." I think about those I've met over the past year. I protected most of them but a few failures come to mind. "One of them was someone very dear to me." I think about Preacher and how I wasn't even there to try and protect him and that it was my fault. I think about his sister Melissa, her daughter, and Chad. I vow to myself, I will protect them not only for Preacher but because I have failed in the past. I tell Andrews, "We'll do better. There will be no Closings today."

End Katharine's view...

Kat walked past the couch and headed for Melissa's office as Andrews followed her with his eyes. He considered what she meant by Closings. It must have been the slip of the tongue and that Kat just meant Closing. Andrews turned his attention back to the video feed. He also vowed that no one he was protecting would come to any harm.

Katharine's view...

I continue through the hallway, then open the door, and walk into the office. Kimberly's there staring down at her H.H.C., looking all scared and depressed like she's watching someone dig her own grave. I wonder if I should leave her to her thoughts, but I don't think it would do her any good to linger on her possible death, so I ask, "Did you get in touch with Thanatos?"

"He said he would contact Voice but for now..."

I study her face and know that helpless look; it's an expression I've come accustomed to showing, and it's one of the worst experiences in the world. I want to console her. I've been in her situation when no one's been there for me, but I've also been in her situation when someone was. My attempt to tell her I'll be there for her doesn't come out as I hope as I say, "It's not the best feeling to know someone's trying to kill you."

Kimberly's view...

"How would you know?" I snap as I lift my gaze and glare at that woman. I hate it when people try to sympathize with something they have no understanding of. It's like humoring a child so that the child will leave you alone. I'm no child!

Katharine's view...

Kimberly's outburst is filled with fear and anxiety, and I don't reply to it. I only stare at her with a look of understanding. I'm so bad with words, I'm so bad at trying to express what I truly feel. I know I can only try, but sometimes it's so hard feeling this helpless. I continue to look at her with a look of understanding. It's all I can do now and if Kimberly doesn't know by now that I do understand how she feels, then there's no arguing with her.

I want to help her, but I also have to understand how our relationship stands. I'm on the outside looking in a window to Kimberly's life. I feel alone in a crowded world, but how does she feel? Does she feel the same way or is she as cold as she puts on?

Kimberly's view...

I notice her gazing at me with a compassionate look, and I almost yell at her, but then I realize that woman's not mollycoddling me but being sincere, so there's no need of me to have snapped at her. The current situation with my job, not that woman is why I'm all wound up and angry.

I tell her with a bit less anger, "I'm sorry. You of all people do understand what it's like to be hunted."

Katharine's view...

I'm amazed that she actually apologized to me. I don't think I've ever heard her apologize for anything. Again I find that I don't have any words for her. I'm stuck being the quiet one.

Kimberly's view...

I grab my H.H.C. from the desk, pick up my knapsack, place the device in it, and tell her, "There's nothing more I can do but stay alive."

I do need to complete my Closing when the time comes, and that woman isn't going to make it easy, not easy one bit. Hades! My life's becoming complicated.

End Kimberly's view...

Earlier in the living room by the entry...

Andrews tapped the button on his earpiece as he stared at the video feed. "Johnson, there's a large man moving across the street towards the house. He is wearing a WM-D and carrying what appears to be a gasoline can and a large gun case."

In the kitchen...

Johnson moved to the door that connected to the living room. "What's the man doing now?"

In the entry...

Andrews looked at the H.H.C. "The man is making his way up the stoop." Andrews pulled his gun. "The man is dousing the house with the gasoline. Do I engage?"

In the kitchen...

"Negative. I repeat negative." Johnson turned to Melissa and said in a voice that didn't betray his apprehension, "Go upstairs with Daniels."

Without hesitation, Melissa set down her mug and rushed up the steps from the kitchen.

"Daniels, the Closers are making their move," Johnson relayed as he hurried into the living room.

Upstairs...

"Understood," Daniels replied and turned as Melissa came up the stairs to him, and he ushered her into Bonnie's bedroom. "Wake the children. Get them ready to move if we have to."

A lump formed in her throat, and she swallowed hard as she entered the little girl's room. Melissa tried to hide her panic. "Wake children." She closed the door. "Time to get dressed."

Downstairs...

"What's going on?" Kat asked as she and Kim walked into the living room.

Johnson pulled his gun. "We believe the Closers are making their move." He took Andrews' H.H.C. and watched the video feed.

Outside...

The mountain of a man emptied the gas container and set it on the stoop. The Raven removed the Thompson Submachine Gun from its case and aimed it up in the air as if posing for a gangster photo, and then he removed a lighter, turned to the camera, and flicked it on. A small flame came to life.

"Shoot him before he lights the gas!" Andrews shouted, moving toward the front door.

"Wait!" Johnson yelled. "You could ignite the liquid with your gunfire and that antique he's holding will cut you in half. Besides that–" He panned the camera, searching the street. "–wasn't there supposed to be two Closers?"

Kat glanced over Johnson's arm to the H.H.C., peered at the video, and replied, "Yes, maybe he's trying to distract us." She quickly headed for the kitchen. "I'm going to check the back door." Kat hurried through the kitchen and into the laundry room, unlocking the knobs as she went and then cautiously opened the door to the backyard. All seemed fine but... There was a petroleum scent on the wind, and it was more than the smell of Tainted Rain; it was gasoline! She wondered if she was smelling the gas from the front. No, it wasn't faint, so it had to be close. Kat glanced at the wooden fence and rushed back into the house, making sure to lock the doors behind her.

In the living room...

"What did you find?" Johnson asked as Kat returned.

"The back fence is doused with gas and leaves both our exits blocked." She moved to his side to watch the video feed. "My guess is the second Closer is waiting somewhere outback." The camera feed showed the Raven standing on the stoop with the lit lighter in his hand as a breeze whipped the small flame.

"What is he waiting for? Do they plan on burning us out?" Andrews asked.

"More like lure us out," Kim answered. "Death by fire doesn't pay that much. There's property damage the Closer is liable for and that comes out of their pay." Both bodyguards gave her an odd glance, so she added, "Or so I've heard."

Kimberly's view...

Hades! I'm not very good at keeping my mouth shut, and it might get me killed. I look at both bodyguards to see if they've caught on to that woman's stupid ruse, but both of them are more concerned with the security camera feed.

"If we don't make a move soon, they will set the fires," Johnson says.

"What do we do?" Andrews questions as I'm wondering the same thing. I don't save people for a living, I end their miserable lives.

"What if... What if the Closers are not sure of their target?" that woman inquires. "Will they still take the shot?"

"They aren't supposed to," Johnson answers. "Why do you ask?"

"I have a plan, but it'll leave everyone in the open. Are you sure they will light the gas?" that woman asks.

"Very sure," Johnson answers. "If we don't come out of the house like they hope, either way by threat or for real, they'll get us outside."

"I agree," I chime in since I am the expert. "Closers don't bluff. He'll set the fire if we don't go outside."

"Gather everyone together," that woman orders us as she grabs her backpack from the couch and puts her Ravlek Vest on over her jacket. "We don't have much time."
Chapter Forty

Plans Into Action

Fifteen minutes earlier...

The raven flew across the street and landed next to the wolf in an alley beside the Bes Hotel, and the wolf looked at the large bird with its golden-yellow eyes. Across the street from them was Melissa's safe house. The raven cawed and took once more to the dark sky and from its lofty view, the large bird looked over the vicinage and surveyed the area. Death would soon be on the wind.

About a block away from Melissa's safe house, Nikolai sat in the Cadillac. He removed his suit jacket, laid it on the back seat, reached into the glove box, and removed the Glock 19. "It is time. Are you ready, my sister? We have been given the go-ahead."

"Yes." Natasha checked the wrist sheathes and whispered to her knives, "Do not worry, my Sweets. You will taste blood soon enough."

"Then let us begin our job. There are no restrictions on which Closing we perform first."

"I am pleased Voice gave us the go-ahead to an early Closing for the Phoenix."

Nikolai tucked the Glock 19 in a holster strapped to his back, grabbed a box, opened it, and removed a Winnow Mask type D. He looked over the full head gear and decided the military version would do nicely. He opened the ashtray under the vehicle's console and removed a plain metal lighter. Nikolai put the WM-D on, grabbed his jacket from the back, exited the car, and placed the jacket on. He put the lighter in his pocket and headed for the trunk.

Natasha threw her coat in the backseat, put on her WM-D, and joined her brother as he opened the back. "Oh... That smell. It is awful!" She waved her hand in front of her mask and motioned inside. "I can smell that thing even through the filter."

"I almost forgot I grabbed it." Nikolai looked at the thing in the trunk. "What you smell is the smell of urine."

"Are you going to use that thing now?" his sister asked.

"No, not yet. It might come in handy later." Nikolai punched the thing in the face, rolled it on its side, and removed the Thompson Submachine Gun's case and a gasoline can. He set both items on the sidewalk and shut the trunk. "Tasha, are you clear on the plan?" he asked over the Winnow Mask's transmitter.

"Yes, very clear." She straightened her red leather outfit, grabbed a gasoline can, a rifle, her satchel, and started across the street.

A few minutes passed, and her brother crossed. A couple walking down the sidewalk looked up and saw the man in the WM-D, his gasoline can, and gun case. They turned and went back the way they came. Nikolai laughed and made his way up to the stoop. He threw the gas on the house, removed the Tommy, and lit the lighter. "Alright you muckers, I'm the gee picked for this Closing, so let's do this," he shouted and then said over the WM-D transmitter, "Tasha, I'm in position."

"As am I." Natasha stood on the roof of an adjacent house overlooking Melissa's backyard. She lifted the rifle and looked through the scope and said, "One of them has come out. She is the woman who was with the Phoenix. I am taking aim. It is too late, she has gone back in."

"No matter," Nikolai replied. "They should flee the house soon and then we will have our fun."

"Are you sure they will split into two groups?" Natasha questioned.

"It is my guess they will if they flee before I set the fire, and I believe they will also do so if I start the fire." He shifted his weight and then said, "If they prolong anymore, I will set it ablaze and if it comes to that, they may all leave at once or split into two or more groups so be on your guard, my sister."

Natasha removed a knife, glanced at a road flare she held in the other hand, and then looked at the back door. A few more minutes went by, and she said, "Nothing new on my end. This is boring. Do make them come out."

"It is time." He stepped back and threw the lit lighter at the side of the house. The gas ignited, and flames quickly engulfed the wall and front door.

"I have movement!" Natasha yelled, excited as she readied to throw her knife, preferring to use it over the rifle.

A blur of dark colored material emerged from the house and made its way to the gate and at first, she didn't know what it was, and then she realized it was a large blanket or two. A hand reached up from under the forest-green comforter and opened the gate, and they started out the gate like a delirious Chinese parade dragon.

"A group of them has come out of the house covered with two large blankets," she reported as she drew back her hand to release a deadly knife. Two bullets whizzed by her head, and she ducked behind the ledge of the roof. Natasha pulled the top of the road flare, threw it over the roof, and hit the fence. The gasoline ignited, and flames rapidly spread across the wood as a little girl screamed. The fire lapped at the comforter and hissed as it was repelled by the cloak of forest-green. The flames ate away at the wooden fence but cowered from the comforter as the last of the Chinese parade dragon exited the gate. A second wave of bullets whizzed by Natasha, and she heard the little girl scream again.

"Nikolai!" Natasha yelled. "They made it past the fence and are running through the vacant lot. I don't know how many came out."

"Understood." Nikolai aimed the Tommy at the front door consumed by flames and shot. He sent an onslaught of metal, hoping to clear a path inside for himself. He stopped, reloaded, ran at the door like a maniac, and kicked it in. Nikolai quickly checked inside the entry, then the living room, and soon he had checked the entire house. "Tasha."

"Yes, my brother."

"The house is clear. They all must have escaped out the back. Have you followed them?"

"Yes, they have gone underground like rats. They have made our job much more interesting." Natasha glanced behind herself and saw Melissa's safe house burning as the flames lit up the dark heavens in a halo of red, yellow, and orange. "Do bring the car to the back street. It is time we ashed the Phoenix."
Chapter Forty-one

Underground

Earlier...

The safe house...

"This is the plan," Kat began as she stood at the laundry room sink, drowning two large comforters. "We'll cover ourselves with these blankets and hopefully, they'll confuse the Closers long enough for us to escape out the back fence. The wet blankets should protect us if the Closers ignite the gas. We'll position the three bodyguards up front, Melissa, Chad, and Bonnie in the middle, and me and Kimberly in the back."

Johnson asked, "Once we clear the fence, then what?"

"Then we head for the abandoned subway and make our stand down there." Kat dried her hands on a towel. "Do you have all your equipment?"

The three bodyguards looked at their duffle bags, and Kim glanced at her knapsack, and then everyone nodded.

"Good." Kat slung her backpack over her Ravlek Vest. "Let's head out." She picked up the dripping forest-green blankets and handed one to Johnson and the other to Daniels.

"Mommy, I'm scared." Bonnie squeezed her mother's hand as she shook her head and her black curly hair bounced. "I don't want to play this game."

"I know honey, but we're only going to play it for a little while." Melissa knelt beside her daughter. "All right?"

Bonnie rubbed her eye. "I'm tired."

"I know honey." Melissa wiped a tear from her own cheek. "I know you're tired, so for mommy, please... Please play the game."

The little girl nodded. "All right."

The group of eight formed a line at the back door and covered themselves with the two wet blankets, but the lineup had changed slightly. It became Daniels' job to hold the blankets together. Johnson led, followed by Andrews then Chad. Melissa and Bonnie were behind Daniels and then Kim and Kat. Melissa kept Bonnie by her side. It was dark under the comforters, and all each person could see was the tile floor and the person in front of them. The blankets dripped, forming small puddles and soaked the tops of the group.

"Everyone ready?" Johnson asked.

Andrews looked at his H.H.C. to keep an eye on Nikolai. "Johnson, the Closer threw the lighter! The front's on fire!"

"Move!" Johnson yelled as he opened the back door.

They all hurried out. Johnson kept a fast pace, but one Chad and Bonnie could keep up with and as they neared the gate, he reached his hand out. Kat flipped the side of her blanket up a little, looked up from the darkness of the comforter, and noticed a figure on the rooftop of the neighbor's house. Kat saw the glint of metal as the Wolf raised a knife, so Kat fired two warning shots over her head, and the Wolf ducked.

"Did you get them?" Kim asked.

"No."

"No? I thought you're supposed to be a good shot."

Kat didn't reply as Johnson opened the gate, and the group started through.

"Well? Why did you miss?" Kim questioned.

"I wasn't aiming for her," Kat answered.

"Are you serious?" Kim yelled, but the rest of the sentence was muffled by the bodyguards' shouts.

Natasha had thrown the road flare on the doused wood, fire consumed the fence, and Bonnie screamed. Melissa picked up the crying child and carried her. Fire lapped at the blankets and hissed as the water soaked material repelled the flames. The group felt the heat at their legs and heard the crackle and before Kat exited the gate, she fired a second time at the Wolf.

Bonnie covered her ears for the loud bangs and finally screamed again in fear. "Mommie, I want to go home!"

Melissa broke down crying. "It will be all right. It will be all right."

Johnson led them through the vacant lot, across the deserted street, and to the cage surrounding the entrance to the subway. He withdrew his gun, fired several times at the lock, opened the chain-link gate, and started down the stairs and once they reached the bottom, they removed the two blankets and dropped the smoldering comforters to the floor. Bonnie still cried, and Chad was pale with fright. The area was dark so the bodyguards, Melissa, Kim, and Kat removed flashlights and continued.

"Everyone, this way," Johnson ordered, making his way down a hall. He glanced back several times to see if the Closers followed.

"Johnson, what do you think?" Kat asked. "Should we split up or stay together?"

"Split up," Johnson answered as they came to a line of turnstiles. He helped Chad over as Andrews and Daniels assisted Melissa and Bonnie.

They continued and went down a second set of stairs and ahead of them about fifty feet, they saw lights and a crossing passage.

"The power's still on," Daniels said surprised. "Do you think people are living down here?"

"Never know," Andrews said. "But once the gunfire starts, we don't have to worry about it."

Everyone turned off their flashlights as they entered the lighted passage.

Johnson led them and stopped at the end where it opened to a platform. "We'll split up here. Me, Andrews, and Daniels will go back and hold off the Closers as long as we can."

"Okay." Kat studied the platform and the narrow sidewalk that continued to another passage through a tunnel. "Me and Kimberly will take Melissa and the children to the next platform and there, we'll find somewhere to hide." She looked at Kim. "We'll protect them with our lives," Kat spoke and then emphasized the next statement as she said, "No harm will come to them." She noticed Kim glared at her, and it was a subtle glare.

Kat led, followed by Melissa carrying Bonnie, then Chad and Kim hurried behind them. They quickly walked across the narrow sidewalk that ran along the tunnel, then they rushed through the passage and after about fifteen minutes, they heard gunfire.

Melissa paused. "The men!"

"We have to hurry and stick with the plan," Kat insisted, and Melissa nodded to her and followed.

The five of them continued across the narrow sidewalk as it curved around a corner, and then it headed for a second platform and there a subway train stood where it had been abandoned nearly three decades ago. They passed many posters on the walls that depicted a bygone era, and one caught Kat's eye; it was of a sunny beach and written on it was, "Wish you were somewhere else?"

Kat moved to the first car. "Kimberly, give me a hand." She tried to pry the sliding doors open.

"What are you thinking?" Kim asked.

"That we don't have much time."

Together they forced the doors opened, and then Kat said, "Quickly, everyone in. The Closers will be here soon."

Melissa ushered the children in and whispered, "You don't think Johnson and the others will stop them?"

Kat looked at Kim who shook her head, and Kat replied, "It's better to be prepared in case they don't succeed. Now quickly get in." Kat took one last look at the tunnel they had come through, and then she followed Melissa and the others.
Chapter Forty-two

Red Brick Street

Earlier...

5:59 P.M...

The next road over from Brownstone Street...

Red Brick Street was for the most part empty. A tall iron clock chimed six times as a stray brown cat scurried up a Transgenic Maple and scanned the road below. Something stalked it from the shadows, and it was something that didn't belong in the city. A breeze rustled the leaves of the maple and parted the veil of green that concealed the feline and within the safety of the tree, the cat turned its attention above. A large raven cawed from the dark sky like an omen of death, then the cat hissed at the black bird, and it hissed until a howl sounded across the neighborhood. The feline lay low on the branch, hiding from the foreign invader as the wolf walked across the vacant lot to the tree, looked at the cat, and then to her brother in the feather. The raven floated on the wind and then soared with the drafts. The house behind the wolf burned as sirens blared in the distance, and she sniffed the air filled with the scent of smoke and petroleum as hunger rumbled her stomach. The wolf studied the feline, knowing this dinner had evaded her and stood still as the breeze brushed her thick fur. She would not be able to resist her hunger or her bloodlust for much longer.

Across the street...

Nikolai and Natasha stood at the back of the Cadillac and stared inside the open trunk, and Natasha winked at the thing in the trunk.

"Tasha, the bodyguards and the Phoenix will be waiting for us." He spoke over the transmitter of the Winnow Mask as he lifted the Tommy to rest his elbow on his side.

"Yes, I know." She glanced at two of the small canisters she retrieved from the backseat. "These will make things fairer, that is, fairer for us, and do not forget the Phoenix has a friend. The woman who mocked us with the piece of candy must also be eliminated."

"I have not forgotten about her, and her death should be easy enough to write off in our report for Voice." He looked at his sister. "When the time comes, do you want to take care of her?"

"Yes, she is mine and the Phoenix is yours." She looked at the canisters. "Will these be enough to break their lines?"

"Those and the surprise I picked up from Wayfaring Lane should be enough, my sister." He reached into the trunk and grabbed the thing. "Time to go, my friend." Nikolai curled his lip and in his best impression of a gangster, said, "Time to bring this show to an end."

Down in the subway...

Johnson waited at one of the corners across the hall about fifty feet from the bottom of the second set of stairs. The lighted passage stood behind them along with the first platform and the subway track, and he glanced at Daniels who knelt beside him and took aim for the steps. Andrews waited at the other corner, watching the hall, and Andrews glanced at the grenades and spare magazines in his duffle bag.

"I hear someone coming," Johnson said. "Get ready!"

They tensed as seconds then minutes went by and for a moment, they thought it was a false alarm till a sound grabbed their attention. A small object clanged down the second set of stairs like a tin can, and it landed at the bottom of the steps, rolled in their direction, and hissed opened, spraying white smoke. The fog-like substance thickened till it created a cloudy wall, and then a wave of bullets fired from the stairs. They ducked around the corners, taking cover and after the metal barrage ended, they blindly shot into the smoke. They heard a muffled cry and someone fall to the concrete floor, and a large hand fell out of the smoke, holding a Glock 19.

"Did we get one of them?" Daniels asked.

"Looks like it," Andrews answered. "Be careful though, there's still a second Closer out there."

"Do not shoot," Natasha yelled as she came out of the smoke, holding her side.

"Raise your hands and kneel," Andrews shouted.

She lifted her hands and knelt as if in pain as blood covered her one hand and side. "Do not shoot," Natasha repeated and glanced at the man beside her. "My brother!" She bowed her head and sobbed. "You have killed my brother."

Andrews and Daniels cautiously moved toward them as the smoke slowly dissipated, and Johnson covered them from the corner. Natasha continued sobbing, then she lifted her head and wailed, and then her cries turned to laughter. Andrews and Daniels stopped about six feet from her.

"Fools!" she yelled and dove to the floor.

The smoke dissipated enough that they could see a third figure had appeared at the top of the stairs.

Andrews looked at the man on the floor. He was dirty and wore worn clothes. "He's a vagrant," he said and yelled, "Johnson, it's a trap!" Andrews raised his gun, but it was too late.

Nikolai turned his Tommy on them and opened fire from the top of the stairs. His attack took down Andrews and Daniels. Johnson opened fire as Natasha threw a second canister across the hall towards him, and the white smoke blocked his view.

He pressed the button on his earpiece and yelled, "Andrews! Daniels! Are you all right?" There was no answer, so Johnson frantically repeated, "Andrews! Daniels! Are you all right?" There was still no answer. They had been tricked, so Johnson grabbed his duffle bag and cursed, "Hathor!"

He ran for the platform and then in the direction of Melissa and the children; he had to reach them before the Closers did.
Chapter Forty-three

The Subway Train

6:39 P.M...

Katharine's view...

Silence... For ten minutes, no noise comes from the tunnel passage where we all know the bodyguards are standing their ground. The gun blasts and shouts have long since died, and everyone fears the worse. The eerie stillness numbs the senses and fills me and most likely Kimberly and Melissa's thoughts with nightmarish scenarios of the bodyguards' fates. The subway train we're in consists of ten cars, and each one's connected to the next by two doors that open into each compartment. The length of each car is thirty feet, and each car has two sets of sliding doors on the side that open to the platform. Large windows cover both sides of the car, an aisle runs down the middle, and padded seats covered with dust face the aisle on both sides. Poles positioned on each side of the sliding doors once allowed passengers to stand and wait for their stop. Me, Melissa, the two children, and Kimberly hide in the fifth car from the front. We've opened all the connecting doors running from the first through the tenth car, and the doors that exit to the subway train are all shut. I glance at Melissa who's holding Bonnie as Chad sits close to them, and the silence continues.

Kimberly's beside me, staring at her PPK as she ejects the gun's magazine three times; it's full.

"How's your ammo?" I question, noticing her fidgeting. I couldn't come up with anything else to ask her so that's my lame question. Kimberly's usually so calm and cool, but I guess even assassins fear death.

Kimberly's view...

"I have plenty," I answer that woman. "There are more magazines in my knapsack." I glance at her, seeing the look of concern. I would usually be angry at her for even considering a tiny bit of concern for me but for some reason, it makes me feel somewhat better, and I thank her in my own way by saying, "Don't worry. I'm fine."

It's agonizing waiting for someone to kill me. I don't know how that woman existed in this fear-inducing state for a year. I don't think I could have and if it had been me, I probably would have offed myself a long time ago.

Katharine's view..

"It will be fine," Melissa adds, trying to encourage us. "Johnson and his men know what they're doing." She repeats as if trying to convince herself, "It will all be fine. They'll take care of the Life Closers and then come for us, so everything will be fine. None of us will die."

I'm about to move and say something to encourage Melissa, but footsteps echo across the tunnel passage as someone runs toward the second platform from the first. I rush to the front along with Kimberly and look out the window. We watch the curve, waiting for the person to appear. Johnson rushes around, glancing over his shoulder, and he slows as he sees the second platform and the subway train, and then he searches for us. Kimberly and myself pry open the first car's set of sliding doors to the platform. We glance around the area and check for the Life Closers, and we see no one else.

"In here," I yell as I wave him over.

Johnson glances once more over his shoulder and enters the first car as he pants from running. He mutters, "I'm getting too old for this." Johnson swallows hard and informs us, "The Closers got Andrews and Daniels." He pauses, catching his breath. "The Closers aren't far behind, so we only have minutes."

Sadness, hurt, and confusion have their way with me as I can't believe the news. Andrews and Daniels are dead? But they..? I force all of those distractions to the side. I don't have time to deal with them. I'll grieve when everyone's safe. I motion behind myself and tell Johnson, "Melissa and the children are in the fifth car. Go back and stay with them and give yourself a little time to rest."

He starts to go back and pauses. "Watch out for the Closers. They like to play dirty." He heads back.

I wait till he leaves, turn to Kimberly, and ask another lame question, "Are you ready? We have to stop them here. "

"I'm ready? But are you, Ms. High And Mighty?"

"What do you mean?"

"I'm not the one who won't kill," Kimberly says, and then she informs me, "The only way we're going to stop the Raven and the Wolf is if we stop them cold, and I do mean make corpses out of them." She points a finger at me and states, "You'll have to take someone's life. You won't stop them by merely wounding them. I know their kind, and I have dealt with their kind. The Raven and the Wolf are too dedicated to their work, or more like, they enjoy it too much to be stopped by a mere flesh wound." I don't respond to her statement, so Kimberly questions me, "Are you listening? You can't hesitate. You have to kill them, if not for my sake then at least for Melissa and the children's."

"I'll do what has to be done," I finally respond. "I'll protect everyone."

"Isn't that statement a little late?" Her voice raises out of anger as Kimberly tells me, "Daniels and Andrews are dead. You didn't protect them." She turns to draw my attention back to the tunnel passage, and she states, "They might still be alive if you had taken the shot outside of the safe house and killed the Life Closer on the roof."

"Don't you think I know that?" I snap, no longer holding back my guilt. I'm aware of what my actions have done, and I whisper, "I keep replaying the event in my mind. I know I could have easily aimed for her head."

Kimberly's view...

"For Ares' sake!" I shout as I throw up my hands. "Then stop your whining about killing and take out the Raven and the Wolf. How else are you going to protect me?"

I'm taken aback by my own words. I'm relying on that woman to save me. The Raven and the Wolf have rattled me but even if that's the case, I still wouldn't normally believe anyone would save me. I have to get my head on straight.

Katharine's view...

"I'll find a way to protect everyone," I answer.

I'll find a way for everyone's sake, and I'll do it without taking a life. There's a reason I shouldn't take a life, and I know it deep inside. I can't complete the Gamma Phase. If I do, it'll change everything. I stare at my gun. I won't take a life even if it cost me my own.

"You'll find a way?" Kimberly utters. "For our sake, I hope you do, otherwise, we'll end up like Andrews and Daniels."
Chapter Forty-four

Here They Come

7:07 P.M...

In between platform one and two...

The twin Life Closers stopped before the curve and looked at one another. Gore still covered Natasha's hand where she smeared blood from the vagrant's bullet wound, and Nikolai no longer held the Tommy. He left the empty submachine gun back at the hall where they killed the two bodyguards.

"We let one escape," she said. "It was sloppy of us. He is most likely with the Mark."

"Do not worry, my sister." Nikolai removed a Glock 25 from his shoulder holster; he had taken the Glock 19 from the vagrant and placed it in the other holster on his back. "It does not matter if they know we are coming. We will complete the Closing, and we will return to our homeland."

She stroked the side of his mask with the back of her hand, smearing a little blood on his WM-D. "Let us bring doom then." Natasha removed the second canister from her satchel. "What do you think, my brother? Are they in the subway train or have they escaped through another tunnel?"

"I would be on the train if I were them. It gives them some protection." He turned to his sister, pointed to the canister she held, and asked, "Tasha, how many more of those do you have?"

"Five. Why do you ask?"

"It is time for another wall of smoke. We cannot make it too easy for them to kill us."

On the subway train...

Kimberly's view...

"Hades... I hate waiting," I mutter as I impatiently stare out the window to the curve. I would never make it as a bodyguard. I tap my foot anxiously. "Being a Closer is much easier," I tell that woman. "All I have to do is show up at the spot, wait maybe an hour or two, and bang! The job's done."

"Not so loud. Do you want everyone to hear?" that woman scolds me as she glares at me. "And how can you say easy? Killing someone isn't. Every time you take a life it does something to your soul." She turns her attention away from me and back to the curve. "Anyway, I thought you hated your job. I thought you hated what you do for a living."

"What are you babbling?" I ask. That woman doesn't know what she's talking about, and I inform her, "I don't hate my job."

Katharine's view...

I know Kimberly's lying to me again. Does it really help her to cope with the current situation to make things up? I question her, "If you like what you do, why don't you smile? Why do you always look so miserable?"

Her dismal expression worsens as Kimberly says, "I don't look miserable."

Kimberly's view...

I'm agitated over that woman's stupid comments, and I add, "And mind your own business! I never asked your opinion."

I tap my foot faster. That woman can't be right, no, there's no way she's right. A little time passes, and I can't help but consider her statement. Am I doing something I hate? I do blame my father for getting me into the business. Is it because I despise my job?

Sure... I don't have a life, I have no friends and really no family, but does that make me miserable? I convince myself that it doesn't.

Katharine's view...

Maybe I should drop it, and we can talk about it later. I stare at Kimberly's nervous foot. She has enough to think about right now, and there's no need to make her feel worse than she already does.

Kimberly notices me looking at her and stops the distracting thumping as she says, "Sorry."

"Don't worry..." I tell her as I rub my left thumbnail against my index finger and rub it red. "We all have bad habits."

"Bad habits aside," Kimberly begins as she's the one who can't put the topic aside for now, and she informs me, "I never said I liked my job. I don't hate it, but I don't like it."

"Oh..." I reply, knowing she's only telling me what she wants to hear herself. "That's too bad."

"Too bad? For Ares' sake!" Kimberly shouts, lowers her voice, and asks, "What's too bad?"

I start to answer her, "That..." I pause, realizing Kimberly honestly doesn't see it. She has somehow convinced herself that the life she has is the life she wants. I debate whether or not to say anything more, and then I realize I'm already all in, so I answer, "It's too bad that you lie even to yourself."

Kimberly's view...

"I don't!" I insist. "Hades! I don't..." I stop myself from saying anymore as I consider her statement. I know myself... I know myself more than anyone else, and I haven't become so used to deceiving others that I also lie to myself. For Ares' sake! I've let that woman get to me for even considering her stupid notion.

I blurt, "I didn't want to tell you before because I knew you'd get all freaky around me, but of course I enjoy killing people! Why else would I be doing it?"

She looks upset with me and that woman puts a finger to her mouth and utters, "Shhh..." She glances across the cars in the direction of Melissa, Johnson, and the children, then turns back to me, and says, "Don't talk like that. The others might hear you."

"Fine, but it's not like it's going to matter. We're probably all dead unless we can take out those Closers, and I do mean kill them."

"Quiet," that woman orders me like somehow since our conversation she has become the boss of me.

"Why are you yelling at me again?" I ask. "I didn't say anything about me being a–"

"Closers," that woman interrupts me. "They're making their move."

"Oh..." I say as I turn to where the Raven and the Wolf stand, and they're out of range of the handguns or at least out of my range. I yell at that woman, "Shoot them already!"

Before that woman has time to react to my order that sounds more like a plea, the Raven and the Wolf throw some sort of canisters at the subway train, and soon smoke engulfs the cars.

"I don't like this," that woman states.

I give her a frustrated look as I inform her as if I have to, "You're not supposed to like this." I shake my head as this whole thing with that woman has become ridiculous, and I yell at her, "What kind of statement is that? If you don't have anything useful to say, I would suggest you keep your opinions–"

"Go back and help Johnson," that woman interrupts me again as if she has no fear of what I am or what I can do to her and everyone she cares about. She starts to pry the side doors open.

I'm about to argue with her or at least clear up our roles as predator and stupid idiot, but then I glance at Melissa and remember her Closing. I could use this opportunity to take out my Mark, but I have my own Closing to worry about. I tell that woman without sounding like I'm confessing something, "I would prefer to stay with you."

She grunts as she pries the doors open and says, "Please, go back and help Johnson." She turns her attention back to the Raven and the Wolf. "I have a feeling he'll need you."

"Fine, but what are you going to..?"

Without another word or any more directions for me, that woman races from the car and into the smoke.

"Wait! Don't go out there by yourself!" I yell at her, and then I gripe, "Idiot!" She's gone, and I'm left with a decision to listen to her or... I resent her abandoning me to my fears, but I go ahead, do as ordered, and make my way to the back. I stay low so that I don't stand out as a target as the smoke rises up to the windows. What's that woman thinking? We're partners through all of this, and we should stick together.
Chapter Forty-five

Protect Melissa And The Children

7:25 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

White smoke rises and engulfs the subway cars and the surrounding area. Good thing we made sure all the windows were closed or the smoke would be in here with us. I pause before I make my way to the back and remember that the front car's platform facing doors are open. Smoke floats in, filling the front half of the empty car. I'd go shut the door, but that woman might need a place to retreat to in a hurry, so I continue on to the back to join the others. Johnson had moved Melissa and the children to the last car. Silence hovers over me like fog in a graveyard, and it's eerily foreboding and conceals many possible horrors. I push open the connecting door, and it slides open with a squeal. I quickly enter, remembering to stay low, and then I shut the door. Johnson aims his weapon at me, making sure I'm not one of the Life Closers who might have made their way in the car, and then he quickly looks back out the window. Melissa huddles with the children in the last car, and Johnson squats beside them and peers out a platform facing window. I can't see past the wall of white and that's making me on edge.

"This is the same tactic the Life Closers used at the stairs," Johnson informs me as he's apparently angry over the loss of his men. "They made us believe they had been shot, and we fell for it!"

I squat beside a different window and tell him, "We'll be prepared for any trickery."

"Where's Kat?" Melissa asks.

"She stepped out for a bit," I inform her.

"Oh..." Melissa sounds worried and says nothing more to frighten the children.

"No really," I say, and I'm not sure if it's to convince Melissa or myself. "Katharine went to deal with the Life Closers, so she's fine." I add a smile to my lie to sell it as I state, "So no worries."

Melissa believes me or she at least pretends to for the sake of the children. Melissa softly speaks to them, "Did you hear that? Everything's going to be fine."

I look at Melissa and the children and consider what Voice is up to. The Regulator sent me on this Life Closing and then sent the Raven and the Wolf after me like it was some sort of test. I consider that Voice is watching to see what I'll do. I pull on my left earlobe. If I complete my Closing and kill Melissa, will Voice cancel my Closing? Is that all I have to do to get myself out of this mess?

Johnson shifts his legs as if he's cramping a bit in his squatted position, and then he glances out the window again and says, "We can't fall for their trickery. We have to hold our–"

Large hands smash through the window, sending shards flying, and the huge hands drag Johnson through the window, cutting him on jagged pieces of glass left in the frame. I hear Melissa and the children scream as I shield my face with my gun hand and lean away from the clear projectiles. Johnson yells before disappearing, and I quickly run to the window. I can't see him in the smoke. I'd shoot, but I'm afraid I'd hit Johnson and for now, I need him to watch my back.

Hades! Where's that woman? She left me alone with these people and... I realize I'm the only one with Melissa and the children and that there's no bodyguard to protect the Mark. Glancing at Melissa, I debate whether or not to complete the Life Closing I was assigned. If I do, I'll have to deal with that woman, and she might kill me for completing it no matter what she says about not taking a life. I don't want to get in a battle with her; I still need her.

Hades! The things I do for that woman and lately, I've been going against my nature.

I wave for the three and say, "Melissa, it's time." I move to the opposite side of the car and slide open the door to an empty sidewalk as I continue, "Take your children and run and don't stop." I step to the sidewalk and search the area over the barrel of my gun. The smoke thins, and I see a clearing as Melissa and the children creep out to the sidewalk, and I order, "Go as deep into the subway tunnel as you can. We'll hold the Closers here."

Melissa lifts Bonnie into her arms and grabs Chad by the hand, and they flee. I run with them for about a minute, covering them as they run through the thinning smoke.

"Don't stop," I remind them before I run back, re-enter the side door, cautiously move to the broken window, and glance out. The smoke looms, blanketing everything that's on the platform, and I can't see anything, but I hear a scuffle. I open the side door facing the platform, exit, pause, and listen, and I hear the men grunting as they fight each other, so I hurry in that direction. I run to where the Raven and Johnson wrestle. The Raven has him in a headlock, and Johnson's gun is laying on the ground about three feet away from him as he struggles against the Raven. I quickly take aim while I have the chance.

"Shoot!" Johnson yells through labored breath once he sees me. "Kill him!"

"I don't have a clear shot," I shout back.

"Shoot!" Johnson insists. "Shoot!"

I yell, "For Ares' sake! Fine!"

I fire. The bullet strikes the outside of Johnson's thigh, and he cries out in pain.

"Puck! You hit me!" Johnson yells as if that wasn't what he intended when he ordered me to shoot. He curses me, "Setna's plight be upon you and your household!"
Chapter Forty-six

Happily Ever After

Earlier...

Katharine's view...

I rush out of the front car of the subway train and through the smoke, thinking I can quickly attack our enemy and save everyone. I find that I'm not as gung-ho once I'm in the thick of the smoke, and I move to the walkway careful of my steps. The smoke's all white but for me, it's like I'm walking through a dark forest that completely surrounds me. I'm unsure of my footing as if I'm afraid I'll trip over some fantasy-conceived root or get tangled up in some conjured vines from the wilds of my imagination. The denseness of the smoke gives me a feeling of being lost and isolated. I can't see a thing, so I'll have to rely on my instincts. The smoke smells like chemicals, and the dry almost nothingness of it touches my face like a creepy phantom hand. It takes ahold of me, but I can do nothing to it as if it has some sort of magical power over me. I slowly continue on as I try not to let my untamed thoughts get the better of me, and I'm barely able to see my feet let alone where the Raven and the Wolf are. They're creatures of the dark forest, and I feel like Little Red Riding Hood who has lost her way to Grandma's house. I shuffle across the platform towards the back of the train or I believe I'm moving in that direction. I put my hands out, searching for anything I might run into as I wonder if I'm walking in circles. I wish I had more control of my abilities. I mastered the Beta Phase, but the Alpha and Delta Phases are only triggered by the presence of a bio-mecha, and the ability to sense my enemies would come in handy right about now.

The creepy quiet puts me on edge, and I still have no idea where the silent Raven and the stealthy Wolf are. I thought I heard a sound earlier and that's why I left Chad and the others in the care of Johnson and Kimberly.

I scan the area. Maybe I should go back to the subway train and... A metal object flies out of the smoke, cutting me across the shoulder. I hear the object hit a car behind me with a ping as I quickly move to the side and back towards the front of the train. I raise my gun but hesitate, knowing I can't fire. I have to be sure of what I'm hitting. Another knife flies out of the white towards my neck, and I dive sideways, scarcely evade the attack, and land on my stomach. The attack would have killed me if I hadn't of leapt out of its way. I scan the ghostly mist. How did the Closer know where to throw the weapon? Is the Closer hearing me or does she have equipment that allows her to see me?

I crawl to the train, find two throwing knives lying in front of a car, and pick them up. I think I figured it out. The first throw was a blind throw. I touch my shoulder, a very lucky blind throw. The Closer heard me move after the first attack and threw again in my direction. Maybe I can use the same method. I place my gun in my other hand, and then I fling a knife, handle first so not to hurt anyone. The knife hits a wall, so I throw a second time in a different spot and hear it hit the wall again.

"You have discovered my method," the Wolf yells to me and she's not even near where I threw the knives.

If I'm to have any chance in this fight, I need to get clear of this smoke, and maybe I can draw the Closer back to where we came in and away from the others. I sprint across the platform and clear the cloudy whiteness. Knives fly out of the smoke after me, and they miss.

"Where are you going?" the Wolf asks. "Are you fleeing or do you hope to drag me out of hiding? Maybe I will leave you for now and look for Ms. Odin or the Phoenix."

Her threat sends me into panic-mode, and I charge back into the smoke and lift my arms to shield my face. I run to a wall and put my back to it, expecting knives to fly at me. The smoke slowly dissipates as I look beside me and see one of the framed posters from earlier with the writing, "Wish you were somewhere else?"

I do wish I was somewhere else and anywhere would be good right now. I slide along the wall and bump the frame, and the poster rocks. It's loose, so I remove it, rush through the mist, and spot the Wolf. I can tell she towers over me like a Lantern Pine towers over a blade of Transgenic Grass.

Natasha's view...

I see a blur charging out of the smoke and throw a knife and then a second. The blades strike with a thud... thud... It sounds like my Sweets hit something other than flesh. The plain one who protects the Phoenix must have acquired something to shield herself from my attacks. No matter. I am the Wolf. I have more than just my teeth.

Katharine's view...

That was close! I quickly run away from the Wolf as I stare at two blades embedded in the wood just inches from my face. My back's to her, so I quickly turn around and charge again, holding the three by five-foot poster mounted on a wooden back as a shield. The knives embedded deep through the thin backing, so I don't know how many more attacks this thing can take before it breaks apart. The smoke continues to thin as I increase speed, and then I see the Wolf reach for her wrist sheath again. She pulls another knife but by then, I ram into her and slam her into the wall. The blow knocks her head against the concrete blocks and breaks the poster in half. The Wolf drops the knife she removed, grabs her head, and collapses to her knees.

"Mongrel..." the Wolf curses at me from the floor, and then she stands a little dazed and removes a new knife. "You think you can win against me?"

Crap... My shield's gone. We stare at one another for a split second as I notice she's holding the knife differently than before. It's as if she's ready for hand to hand combat. I drop the broken poster, take a few steps back, and remove my Beretta I had tucked in the back of my pants waistband. I aim and shout, "Don't move."

Natasha's view...

I moisten my lips with my tongue, looking over the not so delicious little mongrel. My prey has no idea what is coming, and I smirk as I peer past her. The plain woman makes a face as if she is wondering what I am looking at and before she has a chance to turn, quick heavy footsteps answer the who as a large hand flies out of what is left of the smoke. My brother seizes her gun and pushes the plain woman some distance to the wall.

He walks over to me with his new trophy and says, "Tasha, she is all yours."

"Thank you, my brother." I remove a second knife and tell him, "Not that I needed your help."

"I did not think you did." He walks past me and states, "She was in my way that is all. I will take out the last bodyguard, and then we can both kill the Phoenix."

"Promise."

"Yes, that is a promise," he replies as the smoke in our area nearly vanishes.

"See you later at the Phoenix roast," I say, turn, and as the plain woman starts to move off of the wall she was smashed up against, I lunge for her.

Katharine's view...

I don't know what happened. One moment I was facing the Wolf and then another I was flying through the air into the wall. I did hit hard, and it takes me a while to move off of it and regain my bearings as I turn and see...

"Oh, crap!"

An Amazon of a woman's running at me with her two blades ready to slice into me. I quickly push myself off the wall and search for the broken poster. I find one of the pieces that's now only two-foot long and grab it right before the Wolf strikes. She brings her knives down to gouge out my eyes, but I somehow manage to block her first attack with my left arm. I swing the wood for her head, and the Wolf pulls back her attack and blocks my makeshift club with her fists that are locked around her knife handles. The wood smacks her knuckles and the Wolf grimaces, but then she sidekicks me in the stomach. I stumble back, holding onto the wooden poster piece. My Ravlek Vest took the brunt of her kick.

"You are not very good at hand to hand," the Wolf comments.

"Is it... that apparent?" I gasp a little out of breath as I grab the broken poster with both hands. "I was hoping to hide that fact."

"You would think one in your line of business would be better trained."

"I mostly shoot and run away. There's not much training needed there."

The Wolf comments, "You do not seem like any of the bodyguards I have encountered. If that is what you are. You did rescue the Phoenix. Why would a bodyguard save a Closer intent on killing the one they are protecting?" She pauses and then states, "Or are you the Phoenix's partner? Is this a trick to get close to Ms. Odin?"

"No," I insist. "I'm a protector, not a murderer."

The Wolf whips around with a spin kick, and I duck, drop the poster, and whirl with a backward sweep kick. I make contact, and the Wolf falls to her side but quickly rolls to her feet.

"Maybe I spoke too soon. You have some training." The Wolf charges with her knives as she adds, "You are merely not that good."

I pick up the poster, bring the wood over my head, and chop with it like a sword. The Wolf blocks it with her blades.

"Tell me. What is your name?" the Wolf questions me through her mask's intercom.

"Kat."

"Such a simple name Cat, Kitty Cat."

"Actually, it's short for Katharine."

The Wolf questions me, "Did you tell me your real name?"

I nod as we continue our fight, and then I ask, "And you? What's your name?"

"I am the Wolf."

"I figured out that much. What's your real name?"

"I do not tell mongrels what my real name is. You should also do the same," the Wolf tells me, and then she says, "Enough with the idle talk. I did come here to kill you."

She lunges for me, swiping both of her knives for my throat. I move hurriedly backward to evade the slashes, and it reminds me of when the Rogue first attacked me. I lift the piece of wood and block the Wolf's right arm. She swipes with her left and makes contact, but she can't cut through my vest. I think the Wolf has finally figured out that the thin vest I'm wearing is armor. The Wolf strikes again but this time, she avoids my chest area and cuts me across my right shoulder. She slices through my jacket. It's deeper than the first cut, and I wince for the pain. We're about the same in strength, but the Wolf beats me when it comes to length of arms and legs. I desperately push my block forward, withdraw the wood, setting her off balance, and leap back. I put my hand on my wound. It hurts, but I can still use the arm. I check to see how much blood covers my palm. The cut's not as bad as it hurts, but I do need to find something that will win this battle. I don't have my gun, with it I would have the advantage now that the smoke's gone.

"You do not seem that experienced in fighting," the Wolf tells me as she charges again and brings her knives over her head as before. "Is it an act to throw me off my guard or are you only a fool?"

I lift the poster to block, and the Wolf stabs the wood but to my surprise, she releases the knife that's in her left hand and grabs my right wrist. The Wolf releases the other knife, drops her free hand under the broken poster, and punches with an uppercut.

"You are a fool," the Wolf declares, "And soon you will be a dead fool."

I don't see the fist till it's a blur of pain in my face. I stumble back and drop the poster as the Wolf comes at me with a roundhouse to the head. I fall to the floor with a bloody nose as everything around me whirls into one fuzzy tornado.

Natasha's view...

I kick the poster to the side and stroll over to the mongrel. I grin at my prey and watch as a trickle of red runs down to her lips, then over them, and down to her chin. The mongrel starts to move, so I kick her in the ribs. She grabs her side in delectable pain. I move over to her and force her to lie back, and then I sit on her stomach, place my left hand to her cut shoulder, and stare into her hazel eyes that look like they are having problems focusing on me. The mongrel winces again as I press hard on her shoulder wound with my fingers.

"By now you must know there are sweets that are treats–" I start to tell her as I remove a new knife from my left sheath. I glance at the blade as it glints in the subway lights as if it is winking at me, and then I say, "–and Sweets that can kill."

I have her right arm pinned down and yet the mongrel still resists me as she grabs at my mask. I bat her arm away and then slap her in the face, pacifying her again.

"It was not very nice what you did with the little sweet at Bes Hotel," I tell the mongrel. "Making us think the candy was an explosive or poison." I stare at my knife with affection as I continue, "Now, I will let my Sweet deal with you but before I do that..." I lean to her ear and whisper, "From Moscow, with love." I remove my WM-D, bend to kiss her on the lips, but she quickly turns her head and receives the Executioner's Adieu on her cheek instead.

I straighten and laugh, amused by her innocent-like shyness and speak, "I did not notice before, but you are cute like a little girl." I stroke her face as if the mongrel is my own unwanted cub, "Are you afraid of a little lip-lock with your enemy? A pity... You could have enjoyed one last sweet before death." I replace my mask, put my knee on her right arm, and grab the top of her hair to hold the mongrel so I can slit her throat. She grabs my arm as I seize her brown hair. I would love to play with her a slight whiff longer, but I must join my brother and kill the Phoenix. I start to cut her throat when a sound in the distance distracts me. I look at the curved walkway that connects the stations as something moves our way.

Step. Drag. Step. Drag.

"Who is there?" I call out.

Step. Drag. Step. Drag.

One of the bodyguards that should be a carcass comes around the corner, dragging his leg and holding his side as blood covers him.

"Did you forget about me?" he shouts.

"Apparently yes, I thought you were dead," I reply. "But I can simply rectify that. Foolish man, you should have run when you had the chance."
Chapter Forty-seven

Sacrifices

After leaving his sister, Nikolai breathed through the WM-D as he walked into the thicker part of the smoke and continued across the platform after taking Kat's gun. Nikolai tucked the new trophy in the front of his pants, quickened his pace, and ran beside the length of the train. He saw the shadow of a man's head in the last subway car, walked over to the window, and smashed through it. He grabbed the man, dragged him out, and then wrestled with Johnson. Nikolai had about a hundred pounds on the man. Nikolai grabbed his gunhand and slammed it on his own knee. Johnson dropped his weapon, and they continued wrestling as Nikolai put him in a headlock. The ghostly mist started to dissipate and through the white, Nikolai saw Kim raise her gun and aim for him.

Minutes later...

"Setna's plight be upon you and your household!" Johnson shouted.

"Did you just put a curse on me?" Kim yelled. "You Isis heathen! Take it back! Take it back or I'll–"

Nikolai felt the bullet penetrate his own leg but refused to let go of the bodyguard.

"Heathen?" Johnson snapped and then grunted for the pain in his leg as he tried to free himself. "You Sphinx wretch!" His face reddened as he couldn't break free of the Closer's vice grip. "You want me to take back the curse or you'll what?" Johnson collapsed to his left knee. It was the leg where the bullet had hit. "You'll shoot me again?"

"Oh, Hades! Stop your whining! It's like I'm talking to Katharine!" Kim took aim again.

Johnson lifted a hand and yelled, "Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I take back the curse! May blessings fall upon your house!"

"Hold still!" Kim yelled. "Or I'll miss again."

"Miss again?" both men shouted.

"It would help if you both held still!" she snapped.

Johnson fisted his hand and hit Nikolai's leg, and Johnson hit the leg several times till he struck the bullet wound. Nikolai bellowed like a bear and released him, and Johnson rolled away from him and went for his gun. Nikolai pulled the Glock 25 from his shoulder holster and fired, and the first shot missed. Johnson fired, hitting him in the shoulder, and Nikolai fired again, hitting him in the forearm. Johnson dropped his gun and held his injured arm as blood flowed.

Kim fired and hit Nikolai in the chest, and Nikolai wildly fired at her as he fell back. Kim dove to the ground, and then Nikolai roared and stood. He lifted the Glock 25 to shoot her when he heard a man's voice then his sister's in the distance, and he turned to the front of the train. He saw Natasha shouting at a man while she was sitting on someone else. Nikolai realized the man nearing his sister was one of the bodyguards they left for dead. He and his sister had been careless, but his sister would fix their error. Nikolai turned back and focused on his current situation as he and Kim stared down the barrel of the other's gun.

Johnson spotted Andrews in the distance and yelled, "Get out of here! You're in no condition to help us!"

Near the front of the subway train...

Step. Drag. Step. Drag. Andrews walked the curve connecting the two stations as he held his fisted right hand close to his chest while the other uselessly dangled by his side. Blood dripped down his injured arm, and several bullet wounds darkened his black business suit. He could still help. He could still make a difference. He wouldn't let another client die. Step. Drag. Step. Drag.

Near the back of the subway train...

Kim was too close. If she shot the Closer, he would fire back and hit her at this range. She had to make a kill shot, and she wasn't that good with a handgun. She kept her eyes on Nikolai.

Near the front of the subway train...

Katharine's view...

The fuzzy tornado starts to slow and then it completely disappears, and I realize the Wolf is sitting on me. I hear someone talking to her, and I strain to lift my eyes to see Andrews some distance from us. I'm having trouble breathing from the kick to my ribs and with the Wolf sitting on me. I want to push her off, but I still haven't regained my strength. I try to look at Andrews again, and I see that he's really injured.

"Run," I try to yell but nothing comes out beyond a rasp. I try again, and I'm able to utter, "You have to–"

"You can wait!" the Wolf yells at me, and then she punches my face. "Be quiet!"

Natasha's view...

The mongrel loses consciousness, and I stand and speak to the bodyguard who is still in the distance, "Foolish man, you should have fled when you had the chance. Instead, you choose to come find us. You must be seeking misery."

I throw a knife and hit him in the left shoulder. The bodyguard pauses as the blade strikes but continues as if he does not feel the pain. He leaves the curved walkway connecting the stations and stops.

"You are seeking punishment!" I yell as I run at him and run some distance before I reach him, and then I spin kick and knock him to the ground. "Foolish man... It would have been less painful if you waited for your death at the first subway station."

The bodyguard lands hard, but he manages to keep his fisted right hand to his chest. He rolls over to his side and tries to get up. I notice there is a wad of blood soaked bandages balled in his palm with only a few strips holding it in place. The poor little rabbit must have nearly lost his hand when my brother shredded him with his toy. I walk over to his side and kick him so that he lies flat on his back. I sit on his crotch, move his hand out of the way, part his suit jacket, and move my hands up and down his bloody shirt, feeling his muscular form beneath the wet material.

"Your foolishness will also give me some time to play with you."

I unsheathe a knife and forcibly run the blade along the front placket, cutting off buttons and then I rip open his shirt. Several bullet wounds seep blood as I place my hands back to his chest and smear the red liquid around as if I am playing in warm mud. I lean down, deeply breathe of the iron-like scent, and the familiar aroma arouses me, and our foreplay starts as I let out an elated gasp. I bend to his ear and excitedly whisper, "From Moscow, with love."

I remove my WM-D, set it to the side, and find the air in the subway does not bother me. I bend to him, put my mouth over his, and forcibly dip my moist tongue to his pressed lips. He tries to resist me as if my fondling is unwanted, but he does not have the energy to stop me. I penetrate his mouth, and the more he fights me the more aroused I get until he stops resisting altogether. I lift from him, and the red imprint of the Executioner's Adieu marks his lips.

"You are quite attractive. It is too bad we met as adversaries. We might have had some good times." I feel his muscles and move my hand to his groin. "Some very good times, my delicious little rabbit."

"S-stop," he says.

"You want me to stop?"

"I'm... I'm going to stop you." His voice rises as he says, "I'm going to stop you from killing them!"

"How are you going to stop me when you cannot even prevent me from fondling you?"

"I will," he says. "I'll..."

Some distance from them...

Katharine's view...

I come to, roll to my side, and see blurry images of Andrews and the Wolf in the distance. I realize I have to move. The Wolf's going to kill him!

I slowly rise to my knees as I scream in my thoughts. Move! She's going to kill him! I manage to place one foot on the floor. Hurry! He can't die. Argus... Andrews can't die.

Natasha's view...

I replace my mask, draw back the blade to cut his throat, wink at him, and then change my mind and stab him in the chest. Gore sprays my mask, and I laugh as I tell him, "See, you could not stop me."

"No!" I hear the mongrel yell who is some distance from us.

The bodyguard grabs my knife with his left hand as his eyes widen in pain.

"See... You have fallen prey to the Wolf, and now I will kill the one you were protecting." I go to move when the bodyguard grabs my arm. I try to pull away from him, but he clamps down on me. "Let go of me, you filthy beast!" I shout and struggle against this once weak and foolhardy man, but I cannot free myself. I cannot believe how strong he is now. He had been as weak as a rabbit's kit, but now he's like a steel trap. "I said let go of me!"

The bodyguard tells me even as death draws him into the grave, "I won't let go. I have you. The Wolf has fallen prey to her own carelessness."

I am the predator but in that moment, I have become the prey. I turn and shout, "Nikolai, help me!"

I hear my brother yell to me, "Tasha! I am coming!"

I turn back to the bodyguard as he speaks, "Matthew... Karen... Beth... I'm sorry. Daddy won't be coming home."

He closes his eyes. and he dies. I believe his left hand will lose its grip on me, but only his right fist loosens and the bloody wad of bandages falls to the floor. The wad unravels enough for me to see that the bandages conceal a metal object.

I gasp as I yell, "Nikolai, grenade!"

Nikolai's view...

"Tasha!" I shout as an explosion flares up and sends my sister flying through the air. I rush past the plain woman who is slowly nearing my sister and run as fast as I can on my injured leg. I drop the gun I am carrying, fall to my knees, and cradle my sister in my arms. I cannot lose her. She is my world. She is my sister in the fur.

Near the front of the subway train...

Katharine's view...

I manage to stand after the explosion, start moving my battered body, walk past the Raven and the Wolf, and walk a little farther to Andrews. I stare at his blown apart form. He sacrificed his life. I divert my gaze from the bloody sight. He sacrificed his life to save Melissa and the children. A deep sorrow flows over me.

"Did you fulfill your sense of duty?" I whisper, then my sadness turns into rage, and I shout, "Was this worth not seeing your own children grow up?" I fist my hand and shout again, "Why did you do this? You didn't have to die!"

My rage vanishes as guilt replaces it, and I whisper, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disrespect your sacrifice. I know you loved your children and with this selfless act, you have guaranteed a future for them. Please forgive me. Forgive me for not saving you."

Moments earlier...

At the back of the subway train...

Kimberly's view...

I cover my eyes as the blast catapults the Wolf backward, and then I run over to Johnson, questioning him, "Are you all right?"

He nods, pulls himself to the side, and leans against the wall. "I won't be walking out of here on my own." Johnson removes his tie and wraps it around his leg to help stop the bleeding. He has nothing to tie around his shoulder. "What about Melissa and the children?"

I glance at the tunnel I helped them escaped through. I still need to complete Melissa's Closing and I believe if I do this, Voice will cancel my Closing, so I say as I run toward the tunnel, "I'll go check on them."

At the front of the subway train...

Katharine's view...

I hear the Raven crying, and I look at him as he cradles his sister. This is all their fault. I head toward them. Andrews would be alive if they hadn't of tried to kill us.

"Tasha, I am sorry," I hear him speak as he weeps. "I should have protected you."

I draw closer and see the Wolf reach up her hand and tenderly stroke his cheek. Her face shows no signs of the blast as her head was turned when the grenade went off. She speaks loudly as if she can hardly hear, "Hush, brother. It was I that was careless. Do not blame yourself for this."

I continue towards them in a slow but focused trudge. Her burned and bloodied left arm dangles, and I see that the left side of her body took the brunt of the explosion.

Nikolai's view...

"Brother, free me from this agony," my sister whispers. "Free me and then you can complete the Closings."

I remember the story of Salandra and Draven; it is the book that inspired our aliases. "I cannot free you, my sister in the fur."

She forces a smile, realizing the quote and must see on my face my heartache. Tasha tells me, "I know." Fear overcomes her expression as she pleads with me, "I am afraid. Do not leave me. I do not want to die alone."

"I will not leave you," I tell her. "I will never leave you."

Katharine's view...

I hold my side as I walk up to them, and neither of them hears my approach. I reach down and pick up the Glock 25 and check the gun to make sure the safety is off. The Raven finally hears me behind them, and he reaches his hand underneath his suit jacket, pulls a Glock 19 from his back holster, and turns his body halfway, aiming at me. I aim back in return as the sight of him cradling his sister reminds me of when I held Preacher in my arms. The deep hollowing sorrow returns, and I know what the Raven must be going through.

"Give up your Closing," I insist.

"I will never give up," the Raven declares.

"Then we're forced to shoot each other," I tell him and then ask, "Then who will take care of your sister?" I remember the name he yelled, and I ask, "Who will take care of Tasha?"

He turns his head, staring at his sister, and then he asks me, "You would let us go?" The Raven faces me and questions, "After we murdered two of your own, you would let us go?"

The image of Andrews flashes in my mind. "You killed two people today." I visualize the photo of his children. "You took away the father of three, and I should kill you..." I remember cradling Preacher in my arms and how I agonized over his death. "But the killing needs to stop." I glance at his sister and remember the tragic story of Draven and Salandra. "If you love your sister, go now. Save her and never come back."

The Raven shouts at me in his grief and rage, "I will not run! I will gun you down where you stand!"

"You shoot. I shoot and most likely we'll both die, and so I ask my question again. Who will take care of Tasha?"

"Brother."

He turns to his sister.

"It hurts so much, and I am so cold." She pleads with her eyes. "Help me. Make the pain go away."

"The Closings." Nikolai insists, "We must complete our Closings."

"Nikolai, the pain. It is so great. If the Closings mean so much to you, then kill me. Make the pain go away."

He exclaims, "No! I cannot!"

"Then take me to a hospital. Make the pain go away. Take me to a hospital or kill me."

He cries over her and then says, "I will save you." The Raven glares at me. "This is not over." He stands, lifting his sister into his arms, and then he starts out of the subway and shouts as he leaves, "You should have killed us when you had the chance. You will regret letting us go."

I watch as they leave and then glance at the Glock 25 I hold, wondering if I will regret not killing them. I walk to the back of the subway train and find Johnson leaning against a wall. I see that he has been shot in the shoulder and leg, so I kneel beside him and ask, "Are you all right?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Your partner asked the same question. Do I look that bad?"

I search the area and see my Beretta on the floor but no sign of her, and I ask, "Where's Kimberly?"

"She went to check on Melissa and the children. What about the Closers?"

I glance back in the direction of the Closers and remember our promise. Kimberly would wait till we dealt with the Life Closers who were after her. I panic as I answer him, "The Raven and the Wolf won't bother us anymore." I pick up the Beretta and run through the tunnel. "I'm going after Kimberly."
Chapter Forty-eight

Questions

8:20 P.M...

Somewhere on the Light Side of the planet...

Voice sat in a dark hotel room in front of a laptop, peering at incoming information from the Assassins League's Closers. Voice's white gloved hands were the only things visible in the faint light as fingers typed rapidly across the keyboard.

An email popped up on the screen from a Guild Prep/Cleanup Crew, and it said, "As instructed, we returned early to the Bes Hotel's rooftop, and we discovered the sniper rifle we placed for the Phoenix as we left it. The rifle has not been fired. What are your instructions?"

"Remove the rifle," Voice typed. "The Phoenix will not be needing it."

An urgent email arrived, and Voice noticed the sender; it was from Thanatos. It had been ages since he made direct contact, so Voice clicked on the message and went over it.

Minutes earlier...

In the center of Noir and several miles underground...

Thanatos laughed. It was going to be most amusing. He stretched, wiped his hands on his black leather pants, and cracked his knuckles. Thanatos moved the swivel keyboard into position and typed, "I had an interesting conversation with the Phoenix."

He sent the email.

"What sort of conversation?" Voice questioned.

"It was mentioned that the Closing you issued for the Phoenix is unfounded. Did you order someone's death with no grounds? The Phoenix is one of your own."

"What would you know?" Voice typed back.

"The Phoenix contacted me and made his or her plea for help." Thanatos rubbed his hands together and finished typing. "It was the only course you left for the Closer after you sent the Raven and the Wolf to close the Phoenix."

Voice's view...

The nipple pierced punk hacked into my system! I'll need to change my security protocols again.

I type, "What do you know?"

End Voice's view...

"I know lots of things," he replied. "Now... What of the Phoenix? Why has a Closing been issued for this assassin?" Voice didn't reply to him, so Thanatos typed, "Are you going to answer me?"

Thanatos' view...

I can't help but think why indeed? What reason could there be? Where is the evidence the Phoenix violated the contract with the Assassins League? Could it be personal revenge? But the Phoenix is one of Voice's best assassins. What else could it be? What reason would he personally break protocol? I can only think of one.

I type, "The Closing is a favor for someone. It would have to be from someone very important for you to break protocol. Is that not right?"

End Thanatos' view...

"That's nonsense," Voice replied. "I would never break the rules that govern the Assassins Guild, not for anyone."

"What about the Phoenix?"

"What about the Closer?" Voice questioned.

"Are you going to rescind the Closing? You have no grounds for it."

"Do you have any grounds why I should cancel it?"

Thanatos typed, "No."

"Then it stands, and there is nothing you can do about this Closing, Thanatos. It's up to the Phoenix, the Raven, and the Wolf, and they'll decide the turnout."

Thanatos' view...

I push the swivel keyboard to the side. I did try, but as my counterpart stated, it's all up to them. I swing the keyboard back into place. Unless... I enter the Virtual Hall of Records for the Assassins Guild. Unless I can find something more on Maestro and here it is. The record says as much as the other one I found in Voice's Archive. Maestro's alias has been retired for ten years.

I tap my chin. I'm missing something. Maestro's specialty was killing children and with that in mind, I have to consider that the hit on Mrs. Serqet's kid wasn't a mistake but a deliberate act. If it was deliberate, what could be the reason, and who could hire a Closer who's believed dead?

End Thanatos' view...

The Light Side of the planet...

Voice removed a cell phone from a briefcase and dialed a number. "It is very urgent, I would like to speak with R.G."

After a few moments, a distorted voice spoke, "This is R.G."

"Thanatos contacted me about the Phoenix's Closing. He suspects I ordered the Closing as a favor to someone."

"He doesn't know you did this for me," R.G. said. "Do not worry about it. There's no paper trail to find." R.G. paused and asked, "What have you heard from the Raven and the Wolf? Is the Phoenix dead?"

"There has been no report."

"And what of the other Closing? Ms. Odin's? What have you heard about it?"

"The same. Nothing."

"I see..." There was a long pause. "Voice, at this time I would like to amend my request."

"Of course, R.G. What is it?"
Chapter Forty-nine

Ms. Odin's Closing

8:21 P.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

The subway...

Katharine's view...

I frantically run across the sidewalk and through the tunnel that leads away from the second station, and it seems to go on forever as if I'll never reach anyone in time. The area darkens the further I go, and I round the second curving tunnel. I have to find Melissa before Kimberly does. She promised not to kill her until we took care of the Raven and the Wolf, and now with them gone... I quicken my pace, step onto another platform, and come to a second subway train at a third station and with each second that passes, I imagine the worse. Kimberly might have already completed her Closing, and all I'll find is a corpse with two children wailing beside it or worse, I might find three corpses.

"Melissa!" I shout, desperate to find them, "Chad!"

I search through the train's windows, looking for the family, and my heart skips a beat when I don't find them. I think I really messed up.

I turn around in a full circle, searching the area as I wonder if it was wrong of me to try to save both Melissa and Kimberly. Kimberly called me naive for placing a would-be Closer next to her Mark, but I couldn't stand it if either of them got hurt. I had to try and save both of them, and then I realize I did... I really messed up... and now Melissa's probably dead, and Chad... he's... I put a hand to the train and start to cry as I collapse half-way to my knees. Guilt washes over me like the waves a squall pushes over a ship at sea, and I think I'm going to drown in them but then...

"Here!"

I look up and nearly lose it when I see Melissa push open the door of the front car and carefully make her way to the platform as she questions me, "Have the Closers been eliminated?"

Her voice's the sweetest thing I've ever heard, but I manage to contain my relief and answer, "The Raven and the Wolf will bother you no more." I motion to the tunnel as I wipe my eyes as if I've been crying. "Quickly, let's go back to Johnson."

I realize everyone's not safe just yet, so I glance around the area, but I don't see Kimberly.

Ushering the children onto the platform, Melissa must notice my anxiousness for she questions, "Is something wrong?"

"No," I answer, trying to hide my apprehension as I search the area again for Kimberly. "Everything's fine."

"If nothing's wrong, why are you hurrying us?" Melissa asks me.

I have to come up with something fast. I don't want to scare the children, so I say, "Johnson's hurt. We need to get back to him and get him to a hospital."

"Oh," Melissa says, and then she continues ushering the children back the way we came.

"Are you looking for your friend?" Chad asks as he watches me.

I halt and so do the others as I question, "You've seen her?"

"Yes," Chad answers, and then he motions in the other direction. "She ran past here about five minutes before you did."

Melissa comforts Bonnie as she states, "I almost said something as she ran by us, but she never called out our names. I thought since she didn't say our names maybe we still needed to stay in hiding."

"It's best to be on the safe side. Come on." I herd the group towards the tunnel. "Let's hurry."

I lead the group, wondering why Kimberly didn't call out their names. I want to believe that she felt like she needed to give them a chance and not murder Melissa right away. We start through the tunnel when someone calls out my name.

"Katharine."

I inwardly gasp, recognizing the voice. I never even considered this point in time, but now I have to face it, I'll have to face Kimberly.

I say, "Melissa."

She states, "Yes."

"You go on without me." I turn, seeing Kimberly standing behind us. "I'm going to talk with my partner."

"Are you sure?" Melissa asks still skittish.

"Yes, it's safe to go on ahead. I would have Chad watch Bonnie once you get there. Johnson's not in the best of shape, he'll need your assistance getting out."

"I will," Melissa answers, and then she and the children continue through the tunnel.

"Melissa," I call after them.

She pauses, turns, and says, "Yes."

"Don't wait for me and Kimberly to get Johnson out. It might take us a while. No matter what he says, get him out now. His wounds are serious."

Melissa nods and goes on with the children.

I wait before facing my trial of fortitude, buying Melissa and Chad time to get out and once they're out of my sight, I take a deep breath and move towards Kimberly. I know this won't end well as Kimberly patiently waits for me. I stop several feet away from her.

"I see you sent them on ahead that was a wise move." Her arms are down at her sides, and she holds her gun as she says, "I assume the Raven and the Wolf are no more."

Sadness presses against my heart as I consider the ending of our story. Is this world so dark and evil that blood must constantly be shed? I wait a few seconds before answering her, buying Melissa and the children even more time; time they need. I hear their footsteps move on into the distance as they hurry off to Johnson, and I finally answer, "They won't bother Melissa."

I grasp the Glock 25 in my left hand and the Beretta in my right. I don't want to have to use them, and dread grips my soul as I question, "What about the other Closer? What about the Phoenix?" My eyes grow dismal, fearing the answer as I ask, "Do we have to worry about her?"

"For Ares' sake!" Kimberly snaps. "What do you think?"

"I think something terrible's about to happen. I think... I think I might have to go against my pledge to myself, and I'll have to... I'll have to..."

A knot forms in my stomach as I'm unable to finish the sentence even in my mind. I know my words are powerless against Kimberly's work ethic, and I raise both guns. I wish Life Closers didn't exist. I wish we didn't live in a world where death is the first answer to a problem. I wish... I wish it didn't have to end this way.

I state, "I'll stop you. No matter what, I'm going to stop you."

Kimberly's view...

I see now... All that woman's talk about not taking a life was a lie. I notice the sadness on her face, then I remember her attempt to murder Topa, and I believe she'll hesitate when it comes down to it. When she hesitates, she'll give me the opening I need to take her down. I can't stake my life on it, so I'll have to act as though she'll shoot to kill. I hate this though, I hate up close Closings. They're messy.

Katharine's view...

I struggle with my conscience. I don't want to become the killing machine the Council hopes for, but I can't let Chad get hurt. I'm determined to stop Kimberly but merely wounding her won't keep her from her Closing. I insist, "I won't let you hurt them."

"Them?" Kimberly acts insulted as she states, "I have only one target. I'm not sloppy. No one else will die."

"I'm not talking about death!" I shout. "If you kill Melissa, you'll hurt the children. They'll experience the same heartache as you did when you thought your mom abandoned you. They'll experience that same heartache you have now knowing Theresa was murdered! Why can't you understand? They'll lose a mother. Didn't that hurt? Didn't that make you die inside? How can you let another child suffer through that?"

"How dare you bring my mom into this!" Kimberly fists her left hand and shouts, "She has nothing to do with this!"

"Doesn't she?" I grit my teeth as a lump forms in my throat. I try to keep my voice calm, but it's coming out indignant. "Would you have become a Life Closer if Theresa had lived?"

"Of course I..." Kimberly pauses and then questions, "What does that matter? I have a job to do, and no amount of talking will change my mind. I'm a professional. Emotions or conscience can't interfere with my assignments."

The knot tightens in my stomach, and the lump in my throat doubles in size. I drop the Glock down to my side and level the Beretta on to the person I thought would be there for me. I level it at her heart. I'll have to do it. I'll have to kill Kimberly. One shot and it will be over. I'll kill Kimberly and save Melissa.

Kimberly's view...

I was right before... That woman's actually aiming at me. I can try to shoot first, but I still have to lift my gun, and I'm not sure how fast that woman is, so I guess the question is, will she try to kill me? Will she complete the Gamma Phase my mom spoke of and warned me of?

I tell her, "You know what I am and what I must do."

I'll be ready either way; I won't hesitate to kill that woman, but maybe I can mess with her head and throw her off her game. It might give me a chance against her, so I say, "There's no stopping me. Unless you commit the thing you fear the most. Unless you–"

Katharine's view...

"Why must it come to this?" I interrupt her as my small voice yells at me and pleads with me not to take a life. "Why is there so much killing in this world?"

"Idiot. You've had several minutes to take me out and save Melissa and yet you keep talking. Do you honestly think you're going to change my mind? Do you believe your words will sway me to a different path? Do you think I have a heart you can reason with? You do understand I don't. I'm a cold-blooded killer, so do you really think you can change my mind?"

"Yes, I have to for both our sakes." Yearning for release from the anguish attacking me, my eyes burn as if on fire, and I insist, "This is not the person you were meant to be!"

Kimberly's view...

Who does that woman think she is? She doesn't know me, and I'll make her pay for her do-gooder attitude. I ask, "How would you know what I was meant to be?" I bring my gun up as the dark side of myself raises its vicious head. "Now..." I cock the hammer, toying with that woman; I want to see her squirm over her convictions. I no longer think about my own life only that I want her to suffer. "If you're going to stop me, do it now! Or I'm going to kill Melissa!" I wait to see what that woman will do. I take pleasure in seeing her wrestle over crossing a line I myself bloodied long ago. "Do it! Do it before I do!"
Chapter Fifty

Removing Obstacles

8:43 P.M...

Kimberly's view...

"That's right! You're so weak!" I shout as I watch that woman struggle, and I take delight in it. "You can't kill me, can you? Idiot! You talk all confident about saving everybody, but you can't, not if it involves taking a life."

In that moment as I yell at that woman, I see my own hesitation. I haven't acted, and I've allowed that woman time to toil over her decision. I'm letting Melissa get further and further away, and I can't fathom a reason for my hesitation, and then I consider that I take pleasure in seeing her torment. Am I that cruel? Maybe... No maybes; I am that cruel. I would have removed all obstacles by now, so what am I waiting for? Do I really want to see that woman suffer over this decision? Do I want to see her toil over it like the first time I agonized over it? Isn't she an idiotic idealist? Doesn't she need to be taught a lesson? I break through my own wall of deceit and realize that's the answer. I relax in the freedom of my hatred. I want her to decide to cross the line and become like me. The image of my mom, that the music box produces, appears in my mind. What does the hologram Theresa know anyway? Who cares if that woman takes a life?

I shout, "Kill me to save Melissa!" I need that woman to make her move, so I can kill her. I want her to die knowing she couldn't keep to her moral convictions.

Katharine's view...

My arm shakes with uncertainty as I aim the Beretta at her. I can't live with myself if I kill Kimberly. I think about the children. I can't live with myself if I allow Kimberly to kill Melissa. I don't know what to do and this is a decision no one should have to make.

Kimberly's view...

"Well? I thought you were going to save everyone!" My hatred grows as I think more and more about that woman's innocent view of the world, and it makes me sick to think she's so optimistic. "Oh wait..." I'll take that world and make her see its ugly face. "Daniels and Andrews are already dead, so I guess you can't save them, and only one of us will be leaving this platform, so there again you've failed. Well? Are you going to stand there and do nothing?"

That woman won't reply to my taunting; she only gazes at me with those pitiful hazel eyes. I do notice her eyes are filled with anguish and look like they're on the verge of crying. I say, "As I thought, you're so weak. What did my mom ever see in you? When it comes down to it, you can't save anyone, not even yourself. You can't shoot me, can you?"

Katharine's view...

Aiming for Kimberly's heart, I place my finger on the trigger, deciding I have no other choice, but when I go to pull the trigger, fragile glimpses from my past sail by my mind like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind. When I try to reach my hand after the hidden memories and snatch them from the breeze, they evade my mental grasp and float away, leaving only an impression of their brief existence. They leave me with a sense that I know Kimberly and we're connected, so I need to stay my hand. I realize what I am about to do is so horribly wrong, so I drop my arm so that both of my arms limply dangle by my side. For the sake of the inner voice that always pleads with me not to take a life and for the fragile glimpses of my past, I drop both guns, and they hit the concrete floor. I won't kill her. I could never kill her.

"You're right." Filled with defeat and confusion, I close my eyes, shake my head, and whisper, "I can't. I can't hurt you, not you."

"That's what I thought." Kimberly aims for my forehead. "You're weak and useless. The Council must see you as a waste of their precious time."

I've failed Chad; I've failed him and Melissa. I start to doubt my decision. I couldn't pull the trigger. It's all I had to do to save them. There's that impression that I know her but... I open my eyes, freeze, and stare at Kimberly, waiting for her to take the shot. I was supposed to save them. Andrews and Daniels laid down their lives for them. All I had to do was squeeze a freaking piece of metal, but I couldn't! I gave up! I am weak!

Kimberly's view...

It's all too easy with that woman who's more like a child when it comes to her way of thinking. Yes, it's way too easy; it should be more... more challenging. I lift the barrel of my gun and point it straight up, changing my mind about killing that woman. She could still prove useful, but I don't know if she'll help me after I finish my Closing. I uncock the gun and walk toward her and as I start to pass, she grabs my left shoulder.

"I won't kill you," she states. "But I also won't let you hurt Melissa."

Irritated, I look at her hand, then into her determined face, and ask, "What are you going to do?"

"I won't let you pass. You'll have to kill me first and as I told you before, I'm going to save everyone. I'm going to save even you."

Save me? Who's that woman going to save me from? I aim again for her head and say, "If that's how you want it. Fine, but I was hoping to continue our partnership a little longer, but oh well."

Katharine's view...

I gulp, stare at the gun, and repeat with a little more fear and a little less resolve in my voice, "I won't let you pass; I won't." In my heart, I'm still determined to save everyone, but my body's the one who betrays my earnestness. If I can buy Melissa and the children a few more minutes, then maybe they'll flee to safety, but I'm so afraid of dying. My hand trembles as I hold Kimberly back. There's nothing else I can do but hold on to her shoulder and wait for the gun blast and the blackness that will follow, praying I've at least bought them the precious time they need with my sacrifice.

Kimberly's view...

A few seconds pass, and neither of us moves. I still haven't shot that woman, and I don't know why I'm hesitating again. For Ares' sake! What's with me? I know what that woman is and that it will be a waste to eliminate her, but is that the reason I don't shoot her? Or am I regrowing a conscience? No, it can't be that.

I shout, "Hades! We've gotten ourselves into a real mess! I prefer to have you around a little longer but no, you had to go get all up in my business. I have a feeling you would've been useful."

I then think of something. If that woman wants to save Melissa so badly, why didn't she attack me? She could have shot me in the leg or at least punched me, but she acts like she doesn't want to hurt me in the least. Isn't that ridiculous?

I realize I have to eliminate her and there goes our partnership. I press my finger against the trigger when a loud beep startles me, and I almost shoot with the jolt to my psyche. The sound comes from my knapsack. Hades! That was intense.

I hold my aim as I question, "Do you mind if I take a look? It's my H.H.C."

She stares at me with this puzzled expression on her face as she utters, "Ahh... No. Go right ahead." She releases my shoulder and takes a step back.

I remove the device and glance at the screen. "An email from Voice. I'll need to get this."

She nods.

It's so unprofessional, taking an email like this in the middle of a job. I lower the gun and holster my weapon. I open the email and read the message Voice sent me.

"Ms. Odin's Closing is canceled. Repeat. Ms. Odin's Closing is canceled. The Valhalla Corporation has withdrawn their request."

I click on the attachment, and it includes all the appropriate paperwork. I tell that woman, "The Life Closing has been canceled."

"Really..? Is this a trick?"

"No, it's no trick. The Closing has been canceled. It seems I don't have to kill you or Melissa after all."

"I don't think I believe you," that woman tells me.

"For Ares' sake!" I shout. "What's going on? Why the last minute cancellation?"

"Is it really canceled?" she repeats.

"Sure. I wouldn't lie."

She raises her brown eyebrows, mocking my statement.

"Fine, maybe I would but look." I show her the documents. "See. Canceled."

Katharine's view...

Relieved, deeply hurt, and psychologically exhausted, I wrap my arms around myself and tremble. That last second I was sure Kimberly was going to kill me. I feel sick. I would be dead right now if her email had beeped a second later.

"What's wrong with you?" Kimberly asks.

Taking a moment before answering, I lie, "Nothing." I try to shake off the uncertainty, reach down, and pick up the Glock and the Beretta. "Let's go back."

I can't shake off the feelings. Kimberly would have killed me. She would have killed me, and I would have stood there and let her. Stupid... I can't protect Chad if I'm dead.
Chapter Fifty-one

A Lesson Learned

9:01 P.M...

Katharine's view...

We silently make our way back to Johnson, Melissa, and the children. Neither of us wants to talk about what happened between us. At the next station, Melissa has Johnson on his feet and hobbling toward the exit. She waves to the two of us as if she's relieved she'll have some help getting him out.

"We're here!" Melissa shouts.

I'm appalled. They didn't get very far. Kimberly would have tracked them down in no time, and she would have slaughtered Melissa. I wonder though... Would she have done it in front of the children or would she have come up with a story and pulled Melissa away from the group before she did the grim deed?

I watch her closely still expecting her to try and kill Melissa at any moment. I can't trust her, so I don't need to be in this partnership. Surely I don't need someone like her. I think back to the business card I found. What about the clues that were left for me? Why was I supposed to find her? I glance at my Beretta. Am I supposed to stop her? That would be funny and here I'm trying to make friends with her.

Kimberly's view...

I notice that woman watching me. Good for her. She doesn't trust me, and it's about time. She was an idiot to put her faith in me. I would have killed her. The next thought saddens me a bit. That woman has finally learned that she can't trust me, so what will that do to our partnership?

Katharine's view...

I warily walk behind Kimberly. Should I stay and work with someone that can betray me at any moment?

I pause, take one last look at the second subway station, and think of the two dead bodyguards. So much death and for what? Melissa's Closing was canceled, so why did Andrews and Daniels have to die? I don't know. It all seems so senseless but at least the children won't have to see their bodies. We will be leaving by this station's stairs instead of the other's.

End Katharine's view...

With Melissa's help, Johnson hobbled his way out of the subway and to a locked fence. Kim shot the lock, and the group proceeded to the street. They saw no sign of Nikolai or Natasha. On the next block, the safe house burned and by then, fire crews worked on putting out the blaze. A Noir Civil Police Force car drove down the street and stopped at the curb before the haggard group.

"You folks okay?" the male officer asked.

Johnson released Melissa, hopped a few feet to the car's door, and leaned on it. "I work for the Isis Corporation. I'm a bodyguard, and two Closers tried to take out my client." He motioned behind himself. "Two of my men are dead. They're down in the subway."

"And the Closers?" the officer asked.

"Gone," Johnson answered. "They're gone."

The officer nodded. "Well, let's get you folks some help."

9:59 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Residential Vicinage...

Nexus Apartments...

Kimberly's view...

"Welcome back Ms. Griffin and Kat," Henry the security guard says as we walk through the glass front doors. A taxi dropped us off out front.

"It's good to be back, Henry," I tell him as I glance back at that woman who comes moping in. "A very trying day today."

She nods to the security officer.

"That's too bad," Henry replies. "May your night be better."

"Thanks," I reply as I enter the elevator first, that woman slowly follows, and then the cab doors close.

I consider the events of the past several days. Voice sent the Raven and the Wolf from Russia before he gave me the Topa Closing, so why is Voice so worried about someone knowing my identity as the Phoenix? Why did Voice question whether or not I had taken care of said person if I was to be closed? Did Voice believe the Closing would be canceled and if so, is Voice even the one who issued it? Or did someone else call for my termination and why? Am I still in danger? Will I be like that woman? Will I be hunted until I'm killed? The cab doors open, and I walk toward Apartment H.

A man enters the apartment next to mine as we walk by, and then he pauses, comes back out, and greets us, "Hello."

That woman's holding her ribs as she says, "Hey, Zax wasn't it?"

He nods, and then he questions, "Are you all right? You look like you were in a fight."

"Umm..." that woman starts.

"Racket ball accident," I interrupt. "We play a mean game."

"Oh. Well, you better let a doctor take a look at that." Zax walks back into his apartment, and the door slides shut behind him.

"Who's that guy?" I ask.

"A new neighbor. I met him several days ago. He seems nice."

"Nice," I repeat as I chuckle, and then I say, "You do know you're not supposed to trust strangers."

She glares at me as she replies, "According to you, I'm not supposed to trust anyone."

"Oh..." I'm shocked at first by her comment. "That's right. Trust will only get you killed."

That woman doesn't respond to my remark, so I look at Apartment G and consider the man we just met. This is weird now that I think of it. I've never seen any of the other residents since I moved to Nexus two years ago. I always thought it was because of my odd hours. We walk to Apartment H and go in.

Katharine's view...

Mentally and physically weary, I move on to the couch, drop my backpack beside it, and sit. I stare at the TV for a few seconds, then remove my Ravlek Vest and jacket, and drop them to the floor. I lift my shirt and examine my bruised ribs. On the taxi ride over, I listened to the music box, went into the Drifting Time, and allowed my body to heal. A few marks remain. I pull my shirt back down and examine my shoulder. I need to listen to Unfinished Melody a few more hours, and then I'll be fine. I lie back.

I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can be partners with Kimberly anymore. I glance at her reflection in the TV. I don't trust her, so what am I doing here? Can I really accomplish my goals with someone I'm afraid will betray me? No, this isn't going to work.

Kimberly's view...

I pause in the kitchen, trying to think of something to say to that woman, but I can't think of one thing, so I go to my bedroom. "I'm going to take a bath."

I take my time and after about an hour, I walk out wearing a bathrobe and a towel wrapped around my head. The doorbell rings, I glance at the woman who's fast asleep on the couch listening to the music box, and then I question, "A.C.S., who's at the door?"

"One moment, Ms. Griffin," the Apartment Computer System replies, and then a few seconds later, it says, "It is Marc from the security desk. He has two messages."

"Tell him to leave them at the door."

"At once," A.C.S. replies and after a few minutes, A.C.S. states, "He has left."

I make my way to the front door and press the button, and the door slides open. I grab the messages and return to the kitchen. One message is for me and the other is for that woman. I place her message on the kitchen counter, open mine, and read it, "Kimberly, if you could please stop by my office tonight. There's something I would like to discuss with you. Signed father."

What does he want? Is it another attempt to bond with me? I go to my bedroom, put on an aqua pantsuit, grab a purse, and place the PPK in it. I glance at that woman who's still sleeping. No need to wake her. I'll write her a note. I finish writing the note and head out.

Forty-five minutes later...

Katharine's view...

I wake, sit up, and close the music box. I lift my shirt and check my bruised ribs, and they've healed. I lean back and notice the apartment's quiet.

"Kimberly?" She doesn't answer. "Kimberly?" I check the apartment, find the note and message on the counter, and read the note.

"I had to go out for a while. Marc delivered a message for you. It's on the counter. If you get hungry, call down to the security desk, and they can order a pizza for you and charge it to the apartment. Signed, Kim."

I pick up the message that's addressed to me, surprised that Kimberly's worried whether or not I am hungry. I don't know if I want to work with someone like her, someone who only sees the dark side of things.

I open the message and read, "Dear Ms. Kat, I thought about our discussion and would like to talk with you more about organic-mecha at your convenience. Come anytime day or night. The Genesis Arboretum security will let you in. Signed, Adam Greenhouse."

I place the message on the counter. Should I wait for Kimberly to come back? No, Adam didn't necessarily say she had to come anyway... I feel the emptiness of the apartment. I don't know when Kimberly will return and this could be important. It could shine some light on my past or maybe on Theresa's murder. I decide I'll go and see why Adam wants to speak with me, and it'll give me some time to think about trust. Can my partnership with Kimberly work without it? I glance around the apartment. Is this where I'm supposed to be?

I clear my throat and say, "A.C.S."

"Yes," it replies.

"Can I leave a message with you for Kimberly?"

"Yes. What is the message?"

"Tell her..." I pause, and then I say, "Tell her, 'Adam Greenhouse wanted to speak with me, so I went to Genesis Arboretum.' Tell her, 'I should be back in a couple of hours.' "

"Message saved," A.C.S. states.

"Thanks."

I go into the bathroom, freshen up, and then put on a new t-shirt. I grab my backpack and jacket, make sure I have the music box in my pocket, and walk out the door.
Chapter Fifty-two

DR-C Oil

11:01 P.M...

The boundary of the Hellenistic Sector...

The Factory...

The Rogue stood in the Hidden Room, staring at the black stones and wondering what Pandora was doing at that very moment.

"Mr. Pinchbeck," Maven Crackerjack spoke as he walked in. "Oh good. You're here."

"Yes, what is it?"

Maven lifted an H.H.C. and said, "I have some documents that need your signature."

The Rogue took the device and scanned them. "What are you buying?"

"I have found a small collection of Arcamedes' papers and art."

The Rogue signed the documents with a pen stylus.

Excited over the purchase, Maven took the H.H.C. "The collection should be here the next day or so, then I can dig deeper into the mind of Arcamedes." He placed the device in a pocket inside his suit jacket. "I can find out more about the Rushlight we're both looking for."

"Both?" the Rogue turned to him. "Is your drive as great as mine?"

"It would be hard to say since we both seem like men vehemently pursuing his quest, but I believe maybe mine is greater," he answered. "I want to know the truth, and I have since I first read about Ginn L. Irynkissgthie and Arcamedes when I was a boy." Maven paused and asked, "Do you know about drive, Mr. Pinchbeck?"

"Yes." The Rogue thought of Pandora as it continued, "You could say I am fixated on one thing." It walked out of the room and Maven followed. "Mr. Crackerjack, as a safety precaution, I would like the most valuable pieces of our collection brought into the Hidden Room. It is more secure in there."

"Yes, of course, Mr. Pinchbeck," Maven said. "I think we need a new name for the room. It isn't so hidden anymore."

"I will leave that to you."

"I'll keep it simple then. How about the Exhibit?"

The Rogue said, "Excellent."

They exited the passage and entered the Gallery, and two S.C.Ms. stood guard there. The Rogue and Maven left the Gallery and entered Research Lab Five; the room once filled with cobwebs and dust was clean as an operating room. All the equipment had been removed and the walls stripped bare so that the room could be converted, and eleven workstations stood in a line. The Rogue set up its own network of ten analysts with one supervisor. There were three such groups that worked in eight-hour shifts. Each of the analysts wore an ebony jumpsuit with white stripes on the sides, and the supervisor wore a white jumpsuit with black stripes.

A female supervisor approached them and said, "Mr. Pinchbeck, we were able to retrieve seventy-nine percent of the Factory's Central System after the T-3s deleted it."

"Excellent." The Rogue looked at her hand and questioned her, "Do you have something for me?"

"Yes, here is the current information we've retrieved on the Pandora Project." She handed over the H.H.C.

"Thank you." The Rogue paused, scanned the information, and continued toward the exit. "Fascinating. I will go over this in my office." It left the converted room now known as the Analyst Cove.

Maven said, "I'm going to fax these documents right away. The sooner they receive these, the sooner we'll have the Arcamedes Collection." He also entered the hall, and Maven walked one way.

The Rogue walked the other way, went to its office, and sat at its desk; it had been reading the H.H.C. the whole way there.

"November 2, 30 A.D.C. Journal entry for Tech One-twelve. I have begun experimentations on bio-mechas with the DR-C Oil in room B10-104. The first test was disastrous. The K-99 unit went rogue and killed two techs. I suggested canceling the experiment, but the Factory hierarchy instructed us to continue."

The Rogue's view...

I pause from reading. The DR-C Oil could have something to do with why I disobeyed my orders and went rogue. I read on, "November 29, 30 A.D.C. Journal entry for Tech One-twelve. The DR-C Oil experimentations continue. I have requested more oil from the Minotaur Refinery. The last batch of DR-C Oil exploded in an accident in one of the loading bays. The new shipment will be here shortly. The experiment's on hold until then."

"May 18, 31 A.D.C. Journal entry for Tech One-twelve. The latest tests with DR-C Oil have been successful. The K-99s and Arachnoids' functions have increased by fifty percent. I believe the oil is ready to be tested on the Factory's new line of bio-mecha. They're called the Un-Men."

I examine my hand. This could mean the DR-C Oil is coursing through my artificial veins and may be why I am the way I am. I have to know either way, so I will go to this Minotaur Refinery and find out more about the oil, and I will have the Analyst Cove dig up the rest of the files on DR-C Oil while I am gone. I will get to the bottom of this.
Chapter Fifty-three

Techs And The Operative

The Sanctum...

11:04 P.M...

Maxwell and Peters hung out in their small room, consisting of a couch, flat screen TV, two beds, and a small bathroom. Maxwell sat on the couch, playing a video game called "Corporate Acquisition". His thumbs flew across the wireless game controller as his player killed S.C.M. after S.C.M.

Peters lay on his bed, looking at magazines. He sat up, turned a magazine sideways, and stared at a flip down poster and whistled. "Look at the headlights on her."

Maxwell turned, seeing the latest model of the VX Corvette with six Noc-lambent Headlights. He shrugged and turned back to his game. "Yeah. Nice." Maxwell shouted at his player, "Come on, we gotta take out the Vice President!"

"Says here," Peters started. "The headlights can penetrate the darkest night even the darkness of Tainted Rain." He lay back down and flipped through the mag. "That's amazing."

"Yeah, real amazing." Maxwell kept his focus on the game. "If only they would develop tires that gripped the road when it rains–" He stuck his tongue out to the side as he blasted the Vice President. "–then the headlights might come in handy."

Someone knocked on their door.

"Who could that be?" Maxwell paused Corporate Acquisition, stood from the couch, walked to the door, and opened it. "Can I help you?"

A female supervisor in a crimson jumpsuit stood in the hall. "The Council requests your presence."

Peters jumped up from the bed. "What? Now!" He tucked his shirt into his pants.

"Yes," she replied. "Please come with me."

Sometime later...

Maxwell and Peters stood before the Council, not sure why they were there and that made them a little wary.

"You are the men we acquired from the Factory?" Ms. Nona asked.

They nodded.

"You helped design and program the Un-Men?" Mr. Decuma questioned.

They nodded.

Mr. Morta asked, "Are you familiar with the T-3s?"

They nodded.

"We are placing you on a special task force to capture one of these rogue Un-Men," Mr. Morta said. "We have a few questions for them. Why did they attack our previous base of operations?"

"And why did they destroy the Factory?" Ms. Nona added.

"Do you understand your new assignment?" Mr. Decuma asked.

"Yes," they replied.

"Good, good. That is all," Mr. Morta said. "You may return to your room. You will be given further instructions later."

They left.

"Now that the T-3 operation is moving forward, we can focus on other things. What about Pandora and Cerberus?" Mr. Decuma questioned. "Has Cerberus taken out the wayward project?"

"And what about surveillance?" Ms. Nona questioned. "Are we keeping better tabs on Cerberus?"

"Everything is fine." Mr. Morta leaned back, folded his hands, and rested them on his chest. "Our best operative is on the case."

Argus' view...

I exit a black sedan, walk to the sidewalk with my rubber-tipped cane, and scan the surrounding buildings. I followed Cerberus here, and I remove an H.H.C. from my trench coat's pocket and double check the location of her tracking beacon.

Cerberus is tracking down Kat. I look at the Genesis Arboretum. Is this where the battle will take place, and can Kat defeat Cerberus or will she die by the new experiment's hand?

I start around a building to find a way in and quicken my pace. Can I keep my no interference pledge to the Council? How much longer can I stick with my oath when it concerns Kat?
Chapter Fifty-four

Father And Daughter

11:47 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Business Vicinage...

Kimberly's view...

I drive my Corvette to the valet parking of the Sphinx Corporation Third Branch Office. A young man runs around the front of my red car and opens the door for me. He smiles at me.

"Welcome back, Ms. Griffin."

"Thank you." I hand him the key to my car as I step out of the vehicle and straighten my pantsuit. The young man climbs in and drives the vehicle away to park it as I look up at the massive building before me. I enter the main lobby and go up to Level 150 and then walk to Cathy's desk. The secretary's not there.

Cathy must have gone home for the evening. I thought I worked long hours. Corporate life's harsh, working twelve to fourteen hours a day and seven days a week. I guess that's one good thing about being a Life Closer, I get to set my own hours.

I make my way to my father's office. I have no idea why he wanted to see me now and this late. It could have waited until tomorrow morning. I knock on the door, but no one replies and after about a minute, I walk back to Cathy's desk, pick up a pad, and start to write a message.

"Good evening," a male voice says from behind me.

I turn and see the Head of Security. "Orthos, isn't it?"

"Yes." He bows his head in greeting. "Are you here to see the Chairman?"

"I am," I answer. "But since you're here, my father said I could speak to you about my mom."

He nods his head several times. "Yes, a terrible case. One I inherited. I'll be happy to go over the file with you. Call my secretary, and she'll set up a meeting."

"Thank you. Have you seen my father?"

"No. For now, follow me." He starts down the hall toward the office. "The Chairman called and told me he would be stepping out for a few minutes and that he would be right back." Orthos pats the folders under his left arm. "I came to deliver these for the Chairman." We enter my father's office, and Orthos walks around to the front of the desk, lays the folders down, and opens the top one. He grins and looks at me and then wipes the smile from his face. "The Chairman won't mind if you wait for him here. I'm going back to my office." Orthos pauses at the door. "Do tell him I brought him more folders courtesy of the Second Branch Office."

Orthos' view...

I open the door, leave, and then I dial a number. "The Vice President, please." I pause and wait. "Kimberly Griffin is here and as per your instructions, I laid the latest files on the Chairman's desk in front of her." My grin returns as I answer, "Yes, I believe she will notice. She has about fifteen minutes before the Chairman returns. She will see."

In the Chairman's office...

Kimberly's view...

I don't want to wait any longer. I want to go home. I glance at the folders Orthos placed on the desk, see the open one, notice a note on the top paper, and read the upside down message. It's a skill I picked up long ago in high school.

"Chairman, here are a few more folders from when you were Janus and over security for me. Signed the Vice President."

I gasp. Janus is my father? I pick up the folders, turn them around, and skim through them, and see that they're reports from Janus. I collapse back in my chair. My father can't be the Janus I'm after but if he is, that would mean he ordered my mom's death or killed her himself.

I close the folder, turn it back around, and place it on the desk. I pause, contemplating if I should put it back as I found it, decide to do so, and open the top folder, exposing the note. I lose the cool demeanor of a Closer. My father can't be Janus, and he couldn't have killed my mom. It's a lie. Theresa was his wife, and he wouldn't have hurt her.

The door opens, and my father walks in, reading over an H.H.C. He doesn't notice me when he first walks in. He peers up from the H.H.C. and pauses halfway in.

"Kimberly, I didn't know you were here."

I stand, searching his face for the answers to my grim questions. Is he Janus? Did he kill my mom?

"This is so unexpected. Have you been here long?" he questions me as he walks over to me and kisses me on my cheek. I recoil from his touch, so he steps back and must be puzzled by my more than usual coldness, and he questions me, "What's wrong?"

I answer calmly as I eye him with disdain, "Nothing."

He looks at me for a few more seconds, then goes to his desk, and asks, "What do I owe the pleasure of your visit? Today makes it three times this month."

"What do you mean?" I ask. "I received a message from you to come see you, and the message stated there was something you wanted to discuss with me."

"I didn't send you a message," my father replies.

"No matter, I have some questions I thought you might help me with."

I sit, controlling my anger. What will I do if it's true? Will I kill my own father?

My tone puts him on edge, and he asks, "What kind of questions?"

"They're about mom." I watch his expression, his unwavering eyes.

"Oh." He leans back in his chair and tells me, "Go ahead. Ask."

"Have you ever heard of someone called Janus?"

His eyes dilate as he answers, "Janus. Hmm... No, I don't think I know anyone by that name."

He lied to me! I fist my hands as I ask, "Are you sure?"

"Yes, why do you ask?"

I control my anger again. "I want to ask this person a few questions about mom." I open my purse and glance at the PPK inside.

He shrugs. "Sorry, I can't help you."

I give him one more chance as I ask, "Are you sure?"

Mr. Griffin's view...

What does she know? I remember a conversation I had with Orthos. Did she discover something I overlooked?

Kimberly's view...

He's family, so I give him a third chance and ask, "Are you sure you don't know anyone by that name?"

Mr. Griffin's view...

I gamble she doesn't, and I answer, "Yes, why?" I watch her shift her gaze from me to my desk, so I look down and see the new folders, and then I notice the note. I read it to myself, "Chairman, here are a few more folders from when you were Janus and over security for me. Signed the Vice President."

The Vice President? Did he orchestrate this?

I look at my daughter as my heart pounds, and I notice her expression darkens to the killer look of the Phoenix. She removes her gun from her purse and screws the silencer on as I ask, "What are you doing?"

Kimberly's view...

"I'm going to get to the truth," I tell him as I aim for his heart, choking back uncertainty and heartache. "Why did you kill mom?"

Katharine's view...

I'm anxious for some reason the entire ride over. The taxi drops me at the entrance of the Genesis Arboretum, and a security officer lets me into the main building. The guard escorts me to the area where we first met Adam Greenhouse and then to the Sapling Room. I am nervous. I guess it's because I'm going to find out about organic-mecha.

The security officer points to a door on the opposite side of the room and tells me, "Go through there. Mr. Greenhouse is waiting within." He drops his hand and starts to return to his duty as he adds, "Come back to the guardhouse when you're done, and someone will let you out."

I walk through the room with thousands of pots, arrive at the door, pause, and look at a nameplate. The next room's called the Sphere Room. I open the door to a set of steps, start up them through a hall, and walk up a story to a rounded door and wall.

I turn the knob, open the odd-shaped door, and a brilliant light explodes around me; it's so... What's the word I'm looking for? I shield my eyes. It's so brilliant. A few moments pass before my sight adjusts to the brightness. Wow! The room's humungous and shaped like a ball, and it's amazing! It's like I've landed on another planet and all my apprehensions evaporate.

The sun appears on the horizon of an eastern sky, and it's a blue cloudless sky. A diversity of birds break out in song, greeting the morning, and a salty breeze blows across a field of lemongrass, rippling the green blades as waves roar in the distance.

I close the door and walk further in. It's night outside but morning in here, and the clouds... There's no–

"Amazing, isn't it?" Adam yells from a large banyan tree that takes up most of the Sphere Room's center. "My own island of the sun!" He waves for me and urges, "Come! Come!" He takes a few steps toward me across the lawn grass surrounding the tree. "There's much for you to see!"

I follow a stone path through the tall lemongrass and cross a bridge over a pond surrounding the banyan. Koi swim in the water. The wooden planks creak under my weight as I approach him and by then, he has bent over and returned to his work. Adam straightens, wipes his hands on his overalls, and waves for me to come closer, and I squint as I gaze at the ever brightening morning sky. "How's there–"

"How is there sunlight?" he interrupts as he places both hands on his cane. "It is fake. The sky, the sun, and the ocean are all created by seamless projection screens. I even have a wind machine that creates the salty air." Adam lifts his pale blue eyes, scanning his pretend world. "Everything else in here is real though. I prefer living animals to bio-mechas."

"Oh..." I gaze up at the giant elderly man. "Wow. I didn't stand this close to you before. I didn't realize how tall you were. It's almost like you're two people. One standing on the other's shoulders." He eyes me oddly, so I put a hand to my mouth. "That was very rude of me, wasn't it? I'm sorry. Sometimes what I should be only thinking just pops out of my mouth."

I can't believe I said it out loud. Why don't I also tell him he looks older than creation?

Adam's view...

I eye her a little longer, smile, and say, "Don't worry. It isn't like you meant anything by it."

Or did she? If only I could remember her name, then this feeling I have had since I met her might make sense. The sapling's friend... Who is she really?

She peers around again and asks me, "Why is it morning?"

"If I had my way, it would be twenty-four hours of sun, but the animals behave much better with at least a little night cycle. Five hours to be precise." I cough, pull a red handkerchief out of my pocket, wipe my mouth, and throw the handkerchief in a trash. "That's why it's morning here instead of night because the day cycle is different than the outside world."

Katharine's view...

"Oh," I say as I regard the kind old face of the man. He reminds me of someone, and I want to wrap my arms around him and give him a big hug. I get the impression of a grandfather figure but that's it. The person in my mind has no face or name.

I frown, a little frustrated and shift my thoughts elsewhere. My anxiousness returns. He's going to tell me about organic-mecha, and I might find out that I'm one of them. I turn my gaze down to my feet. I don't feel like something created like the Un-Men.

Adam's view...

I notice her gloomy demeanor as I tell her, "Come over here, and I will show you something. It's a hobby of mine." I begin to show her several different flowers that grow in the Sphere Room, and their sweet fragrances fill the air as I motion to a plant with dark green oval foliage with pointed tips and reddish-orange trumpet-shaped flowers. "This is an Ocean Honeysuckle." I point to a light green plant with tiny red and white flowers. "This is a Brick Berry." I bend over and touch the leaves of another plant with blue-green foliage and purple flowers. "And this one's a Verandah." I step to the side so she can see. "And look very closely here." I point to a little green dot the size of a pea. "This is a moth's egg. The female lays a single one and when the larvae hatches, it feeds on the plant." I straighten. "Come." I move over to a wooden box cage and open it and inside, hundreds of winged bugs crawl over each other. "These are ready for shipment. You see, I raise the Death's Head Hawkmoth." I remove a bug careful not to let any of the others out and close the lid. The insect emits loud squeaks as I firmly hold it but gently, trying to keep the adult moth from flying away. "They make this sound every time I handle them. It's kind of like having a pet mouse."

She looks at the moth with a skull pattern on its back almost like a child seeing a bug for the first time. I expect her to squeal or lurch back, but Kat seems very interested in the moth.

I open the cage and return the moth. "Their Latin name is Acherontia atropos, and according to Arcamedes–"

"Arcamedes?" Kat interrupts me.

"You don't know that name." I search her face and still see the child in her, a curious child but there is something else in those eyes that give me worry. "Interested in history?" She nods, so I continue, "Arcamedes was a Philosopher and Entomologist among other things who lived about five hundred years ago; he was a genius ahead of his time."

"Oh. Didn't know."

"He was a very remarkable man. He's one of the reasons I entered the fields of science that I did." I walk over to a workbench covered with pots and garden tools. It's a bench like the one in the Sapling Room. I open a drawer and remove a new handkerchief and place it in my pocket. "Now where was I?"

"According to Arcamedes..." she says.

"Let me see if I can remember what he said. Ah, yes. The moth's Latin name Acherontia atropos." I clear my throat. "Arcamedes said Atropos was one of three sisters of the Fates and a daughter of Nyx."

Katharine's view...

Daughter of Nyx... The file I found mentioned the Children of Nyx in relation to organic-mecha, so the moth might have something to do with organic-mecha.

Adam continues, "Atropos was depicted with a shrouded face and a pair of scissors to cut the threat of life like the design on the moth, and it has a thoracic pattern of a mask with scissors below it. It is a foreboding but unwarranted image." He nods as if pleased with himself. "My memory hasn't failed me completely."

I glance at the flowers, then turn to him, and ask him, "What do the adults eat?"

"The adult moth raids beehives for honey." He grins like a doting parent. "They have quite a sweet tooth." He makes his way to the bridge and walks to its center. "Time to feed the fishes."

I put my hand to one of the banyan roots that runs down from a branch and look up at the enormousness of the tree. I hope there's more to our meeting than just talking about bugs. I join him and ask, "Do you sell them to zoos?"

"Yes." He reaches into his pocket, removing food. "Some of them go to zoos, others to researchers, and some of them I keep to study myself." Adam tosses the pellets into the water, and the white, gold, and dark colored fishes swim to the surface and gulp down the food. He turns to me as if I'm one of his grandchildren. "Would you like to feed them?"

I nod, hoping he would ask and take the pellets as he drops them into my outstretched palm. I scatter a few at a time into the water and watch the Koi feast. "Mr. Greenhouse."

"Yes?"

"In your note, you said you would talk with me about organic-mecha," I say as I drop the last of the pellets.

"That I did."

I wipe my hands on my pants and state, "I would really like to hear about them."

"Let's go inside, and I'll make some coffee."

I follow him through a maze of roots that run from the ground to branches high above, and then I follow him to the center. An opening stands there and wooden spiral stairs, that remind me of a centipede twisting its body around a branch as it crawls, are within and at the top, the stairs empty into a large open room. The smell of cedar fills the air. In the center of the room, there's a large table with a single file folder on its top and at the opposite end of the treehouse, there's a balcony with a wooden railing that looks over Adam's domain. I walk out to the balcony, scanning the small world as I exclaim, "The tree your house is built in is amazing." A salty breeze blows through my hair, conjuring an image of a white sandy beach sparkling under the sun that I'm running barefoot across. The image or maybe it's a memory brings a smile to my face, and I ask, "What kind of tree is it?"

"The tree itself isn't real, but it is modeled after an Indian Banyan," Adam answers as he strolls out to the balcony beside me. "It is also known as the Strangler Fig."

"The Strangler Fig?" I peer up at the long branches stretched overhead. What an ominous name for something so beautiful. I ask him, "Why is that?"

Adam's view...

"Banyans are a subgenus of tropical figs, and they have an unusual growth habit." I grab hold of a section of railing, notice it's loose, move to another section, and grip the railing there. "They usually start life as a seedling on another tree where a fig-eating bird has deposited the seed. The roots descend over the trunk of the host, seeking out the soil below and once they have rooted into the dirt, the fig roots rapidly thicken and lignify." I look at the mock ocean in the distance, hearing the waves crash against the shore. "Where the Banyan roots cross each other they fuse, creating a lattice around the host's trunk. The banyan competes with the host for light, water, and nutrients and with its roots, it prevents the host truck from growing. Eventually, the host dies and rots away, leaving the fig self-supporting as an ordinary tree but with a tubular lattice of lignified roots instead of a single trunk."

"So the tree uses another to survive then kills it."

I nod, "Everything in nature kills in one form or another to survive down to the cows that eat grass."

"I don't know about that."

"You are still young," I say. "A sapling. No... You aren't a sapling. What is it..? What is the name that I'm searching for that belongs to you?" Kat shrugs as if she doesn't understand the significance of what I am trying to ask. I say, "No matter, it will come to me later." I start back in as I question her, "Would you like some African coffee?"

"Umm... Maybe I shouldn't. For some reason, I keep thinking I shouldn't have coffee, so water or juice will do."

"Water it is. If you don't mind, I will still have some coffee."

"Not at all. Go right ahead."

Katharine's view...

Adam goes into an open country kitchen, removes filters and coffee grounds, and preps the machine.

I move to the large wooden table and sit in a chair, eyeing the file folder and after a few minutes, I begin, "About the organic-mechas–"

He grabs two metal mugs from the cupboard. "What's your interest in them?" He places them on the counter and grabs some sugar.

I think about his question and answer, "Can they pass as human?"

"Yes, they can." He places three teaspoons of the white granules in his mug as he questions me, "Would you like a slice of lemon in your water?"

"Yes, please." I fidget for a few moments as quiet settles in the treehouse. The coffee machine perks, and the strong African scent fills the area as I watch Adam grab a lemon from a hanging metal mesh basket and slice it. He places one of the slices in my mug and runs water from the tap into it. I ask him, "Mr. Greenhouse, is there any way to tell if someone's an organic-mecha?"

"Please, please... call me Adam and as for your question, I'm not sure what you mean."

The two cup machine finishes dripping as I question, "Are there any signs like a barcode on the back of their neck or maybe they can't shed tears?"

"No," Adam replies as he shakes his head. "No markings and their eyes have adequate tear ducts." He pours the steaming dark brew into his mug. "It's very hard to tell if they are an organic-mecha, but there is one way." He walks over with his cane and hands me the mug of water.

I take it and breathe in the scent of fresh lemon. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." He goes back to the counter for his coffee and returns to the table.

There's a way to tell, and my heart rapidly beats as I anxiously wait to find out. I take a sip of the cool tangy liquid, trying to calm my uneasiness and ask, "So how can you tell if someone's an organic-mecha?"

Adam's view...

This could be my chance to see if Kat has Ginn's Cipher, so I sit in a chair beside her, set down my mug, and hold out my left palm for her left. "Give me your hand," I tell her. She starts to give it to me, but then she places her right hand in mine instead. It won't be as easy as I believe to get a look at her other hand. I wipe my rough thumb over the lines of her palm and over the minute pattern grooves of her fingers. "Organic-mechas have no fingerprints. They have no lines or markings whatsoever on their hands. I designed them that way."

Katharine's view...

I breathe a sigh of relief and let slip out, "So I'm not one."

"Not one?" Adam chuckles. "You thought you might be an organic-mecha? My dear, I could have told you earlier that you were not. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I would recognize one of my precious children." He asks, "Why would you think you were one of my crea..." He pauses and questions, "Why in all the sciences would you think you were an organic-mecha?"

I shrink from his question. "I..."

Few people know what I am; it's safer that way. It's safer, but he might know of my project and have information on Pandora. He might even know who I was before I became the Pandora Project. I nod slightly, deciding I'll tell him, so I remove the music box from my pocket, hold it in my left hand, and start, "I thought I might be because–"

A female voice interrupts me, "When are you going to get an elevator for this place? You're old. Don't you get tired of walking up and down these stairs, Mr. Greenhouse?"

Me and Adam turn, seeing Stephanie as she strolls into the main living area. Stephanie appears to be a little agitated and specks of sweat cover her forehead. She takes a moment to catch her breath as if she has run up a hundred flights of stairs.

"Like I said, you're old. Maybe you should– Hey!" Stephanie yells as she looks right at me and points like I stole her chocolate bar from her and I'm eating it. "There you are!" She puts her hands on her hips and scolds, "I've been looking all over Noir for you! Where have you been?" Stephanie glances around the treehouse. "Surely you haven't been here the whole time. Mr. Greenhouse, have you been hiding her from me?" She shakes her head. "I guess that doesn't matter now." She cracks her knuckles. "It's time I completed my assignment."

Reports And Files

11:51 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Unknown Vicinage...

The Sanctum...

Two Chamber Supervisors walked the line of workstations to keep up with the increased activity, and one of the supervisors approached the Council. They talked among themselves, so the supervisor cleared his throat.

"Yes?" Mr. Morta asked.

"We have received the report from the S.C.M. team we sent into Etna Toys Distribution Station Bravo."

"Good, good," Mr. Morta stated. "What does it say?"

"The S.C.M. guarding the back was Gel-Tasered, but he is fine, and the dozen K-99s guarding the building were destroyed."

"I see."

"Pandora..." Mr. Decuma said. "It must have been Pandora."

"What was it doing at that Etna?" Ms. Nona asked, turned to the supervisor, and questioned, "Could the S.C.Ms. tell how far the intruder–"

"It was definitely two," the supervisor interrupted. "The S.C.Ms. were able to download data from a few of the K-99s. There were two intruders and both of them were female. One of them has been confirmed as Pandora."

"Like I said, Pandora was there," Mr. Decuma spoke and then asked, "Could the soldiers tell how far they reached?"

"Yes, we know they accessed the cavern through the hand scanners. The S.C.Ms. believe they climbed the first cavern's walls. Data retrieved from the K-99s confirms that they engaged them on the second floor, but only the K-99s activated the elevator."

Mr. Decuma questioned, "What about the rooms up there?"

"Before answering that, I would like to know–" Ms. Nona interrupted, "–do we have an ID on the second woman?"

"Yes, we acquired it by using facial recognition software." The supervisor looked at his H.H.C. and then answered, "She is Ms. Kimberly Griffin."

"The Chairman's daughter?" Mr. Morta said, surprised to hear of her involvement. "What is she doing with Pandora?" He rubbed his chin as he muttered, "Very interesting."

The supervisor turned to the other male member of the Council and stated, "As for Mr. Decuma's question, the door to the filing cabinet room was knocked in and the books in the secret room were searched and thrown to the floor. There's a note on the report." The supervisor paused, retrieving the attachment, and then he spoke, "The S.C.Ms. found one filing cabinet in the secret room, and it was empty."

Ms. Nona asked, "What about Ginn's Cipher that was used to access the caverns? Which one of them possesses it? And once we find out, what are we going to do about it?"

Mr. Morta stated, "Very interesting question. What should we do about it indeed?"

Zax turned his van down an alley beside Dad's Donuts, activated an automated garage door, and pulled into the Maydag Auto Garage. He turned off the engine, plunging the area into silence; the place was empty. Zax opened the van's squeaky door, shut it, and glanced around the grease monkey pit. "I hate this place at night." He went to the second storage room, unlocked the door with a key, and went in. "It's kinda creepy when you're the only one here." The storage room smelled of dust and gas. Zax went to the back wall and looked up at a light. He knew he had to hurry. R.G. wanted to see him right away. He half unscrewed the bulb from the socket and pulled the chain and the back wall flipped around and on the other side, Zax walked along a gray stone passage to a knobless door.

"Identify yourself," a man's voice commanded through an intercom. "Are you man or Un-Man?"

"Funny, real funny." Zax looked up into the lens of the camera. "I'm the Delivery Man. Hurry up and open." He waited a few seconds and added, "R.G. wants to see me."

"Hurry? Hurry you say?" the man replied.

The door slid open, and Zax proceeded in. He quickened his pace, trying to make up for lost time and halfway down a white-tiled hall, he came across the glass-enclosed security desk. The usual four guard team manned it. There were three men and a woman manning it. One of the men looked up and grinned at him. All four guards were armed with handguns. The man waved Zax up to a bio-detector, and he went and stood in the device as the man scanned him for life signs.

"You ready for this again?" the guard asked. "Today could be the day."

"Come on, Tom," Zax said. "We go through this every time I come in. Scan me and get it over with. I need to see R.G."

"Testy today. You need to cut down on the coffee," Tom said as he scanned him.

"Funny, real funny."

"All clear, you may proceed." Tom flipped a switch, and the next door clicked open.

Zax entered and hurried down the hall, and the passage ended at a door. He opened it and entered a dark room with a lighted spot in the center and then he went and stood in it. Zax waited a few minutes in silence.

"Thank you for coming, Delivery Man," the mechanically altered voice of R.G. spoke over an intercom. "I wanted to personally talk with you. I need for you to know what I have planned for Kimberly and Katharine."

"I'm listening."

"I mentioned in the past they would need to be tested. I have tested one of them."

"Which one would that be?" he asked.

"I have tested Kimberly, the Phoenix. I had Voice place a Closing on her at the same time she was to perform a Closing on Ms. Melissa Odin."

Zax uttered, "You did what?"

"I needed to test her resolve. Would Kimberly carry out her job even though she was being hunted?" R.G. paused and added, "The test, in the end, was a failure. The Closing for Ms. Odin was canceled by Valhalla."

"What about Kimberly?" Zax asked. "What about the Closing placed on her?"

"I have canceled it for now," R.G. replied. "It's a shame. I had worked on that particular test since the Phoenix went to Moscow. It was not easy bringing a dead assassin back from the grave to work again, but I did convince Maestro."

"I don't understand. Why would you–"

"Because I must," R.G. interrupted. "We all have a part to play, and mine isn't the least hard. Now... Earlier, you reported spotting Cerberus at their apartment."

"Yes."

"Could you tell what she was up to?"

"No," Zax answered.

"I need to know; they aren't ready for this sort of test, but I guess I can't be in charge of every trial. Fate has stepped in or should I say the Fates?" R.G. paused. "Delivery Man, continue the surveillance of the two and remember, do not interfere unless I instruct you to. Is that understood?"

"Yes."

"Well done."

The single light turned off, plunging the room into darkness until the door opened automatically. Zax headed out.

Captain Creed monitored the Furies as they set up their base of operations. The S.C.Ms. Ultra-black Squad would be ready for the field within the week and ahead of schedule. He had assembled the elite from every field. They only needed to finish construction of the base. He glanced at his watch. It was almost time for his meeting with the Chairman; he'd head up shortly.

The Archive...

"This could be it?" Claviger opened a box and glanced through a few of the files.

The other clerks in the Archive paused from their work and watched the older man.

"Yes, I do believe this is it!" Claviger waved the file in the air like a coveted trophy. "I'll take this right up to the Chairman. He shouldn't be too busy at this time of night, and he'll want these right away." He pointed to one of the clerks. "You, help me with this box. I'm going upstairs."

"Yes, sir." The young man grabbed the box and headed for a golf cart.

Claviger turned to the remaining clerks. "The rest of you continue looking. There still may be another box or two, and besides–" He grabbed his walker and started toward the golf cart. "–there are a lot of boxes we need to log."

Change Of The Guard

11:52 P.M...

Nile Sector, Commorance Vicinage...

Melissa stood with Bonnie in her arms, staring down the street at her smoldering safe house. Fire crews finished putting out the blaze and behind her down the road and sitting in an ambulance, Johnson received medical care. Chad stood in between two gurneys by another ambulance, and the boy stared at two body bags as tears streamed down his dirty face. Three new bodyguards, two males and a female, had arrived about twenty minutes ago. The two males stood close to Melissa while the female talked with Johnson. The female bodyguard nodded as she took notes from him. She finished and motioned for the boy to join her as she walked over to Melissa, and Chad looked one more time at the black rectangular bags; they were like a bath in a bag but more like death in a bag. He turned from Andrews and Daniels, wiped his eyes, and joined the female bodyguard.

"Ms. Odin."

Melissa turned to her and said, "Yes."

"I'm Casper. I'll be heading up your new security." She looked at her H.H.C. "The bodies of the Closers were never discovered, so they did escape. Your case has been settled in court, so the Closing has been canceled officially. The three of us will stay with you for the next few days, and I'll stay on after that as your personal bodyguard." Casper glanced at the smoldering safe house. "We'll get a room at the Bes Hotel across the street and stay there till we feel it's safe to return to your residence."

Melissa nodded. "Let's go there now. The children need to sleep."

An hour later...

The Bes Hotel...

Casper stood at a large window, looking out over Noir from the twentieth floor. She pulled the curtains closed and moved to the couch. The suite was large and there was room enough for the family and the three bodyguards.

Melissa went off to her own room after putting the children to bed and lay down on the large mattress. She couldn't believe the whole mess was over the formula Sunna Snaps she created for the Valhalla Corporation. She developed a completely different formula for Isis and as the courts decided, it had no similarities with Sunna Snaps. She rolled on her side; she had found out her brother's death was because of the drug. She also learned a man named Topa employed by the Valhalla Corporation hired an Illicit Closer to kill him. He had him killed because Norman tried to stop the sale of Sunna Snaps on Wayfaring Lane. Tears ran down her face. It was the reason she couldn't bear to take her brother's Bible that Kat offered her. She felt guilty because she was the one who created Sunna Snaps, and now her brother was dead because of them.
Chapter Fifty-eight

Prelude to Book Three:

Cerberus Versus Pandora

11:55 P.M...

Hellenistic Sector, Cultural Vicinage...

Genesis Arboretum...

On the first level of the treehouse...

Katharine's view...

"Cerberus, why are you here?" Adam questions angrily. "Why have you come to my house?"

Stephanie answers, "I've been sent on a mission." She wears a different smiley face t-shirt, and it had Xs for eyes, and its tongue hangs out like a dead dog. I'm beginning to wonder if these t-shirts have some sort of meaning for her.

"By whom?" he asks.

"By the Council of course. Now..." Stephanie hits her fist into her own palm, and it smacks loudly. "Like I said, I need to complete my mission."

At hearing the dreaded name of the Council, I realize Stephanie's not a friend. She was never a friend. I think of Kimberly and how she treats me. I only attract enemies.

He questions, "Why would the Council send you here? Why would they send you here after all these years?" I can tell that Adam's eyeing her suspiciously, and then he questions her, "Are you here to kill me?"

Stephanie laughs in a way that doesn't answer his question, and I wonder if I'm wrong. Crap! She's after Mr. Greenhouse and not me!

I won't let her hurt him, not this gentle old man. I stand, looking for my backpack. I left my gun in it. The pack sets next to the stairs on the other side of her and out of my reach.

Stephanie approaches the table, and Adam stands and prepares to defend himself against her, so Stephanie laughs, rolling her eyes. "Mr. Greenhouse, I'm not here to kill you." She folds her arms, a little offended. "How could you say such a thing?" She motions to me with her head and states, "I've been sent to terminate Pandora."

"Me?" I utter.

"By all the sciences!" Adam exclaims as his anger and outrage slowly focuses on me, "She's Pandora!"

I face Adam. He knows my project name, and I'm not one of his organic-mechas so... My mind races, filling with possible answers. Does he have something to do with my project? Does he know my true identity?

He glares at me as he says, "She can't be that foul project! No! Pandora was supposed to be iced!"

"I don't know about the iced part but–" Stephanie glances at the folder on the table and answers him, "–she's the one and only Pandora Project." She giggles like a school girl. "You mean you didn't know." She emphasizes the next two words, "You... are... getting old, Mr. Greenhouse. How could you not recognize her?"

His demeanor darkens as he yells, "You're Pandora!" He takes a step towards me as his nostrils flare like some enraged bull. "You dare enter my domain!" His eyes turn wild like a madness has taken him over. "My home!"

I don't know what's going on, so I take a step back and say, "I don't understand. Why are you so angry? You're the one who invited me here."

Adam grips his cane and admits, "I thought I knew your name when you came with the sapling!" He takes another step towards me, but I'm not afraid of him in that instance. He knows my name. He can tell me who I really am. My heart races with apprehension as I ask, "Do you know my real name?"

He glances at Stephanie as if it's a secret, and then he glares at me and rages, "I don't understand why the sapling tolerates you? Why does anyone tolerate you?"

I no longer see the grandfather figure I saw earlier. All I see is this angry man who's standing before me as if I'm some monster he needs to slay.

I tell him, "Adam, you're scaring me." I look at Stephanie who holds her position, and Stephanie looks amused. I turn back to him and say, "Please tell me what's wrong? What has made you so angry?"

He points his cane at me with this great animosity that's seething from his face. The cane's silver tip glints in the sunlight as if it's a sword and I'm a dragon he'll slay. Adam declares, "I should have remembered your name, vile creature! Why didn't I? I have forgotten many things. Some because I wished it and others because of my diminished faculties, but I should have never forgotten you! And now this abomination stands before me! I should have never let you live this long! I should have destroyed you long ago!"

I feel betrayed and heartbroken. I came here so that he could help me. I came here for some answers, not this... this... Whatever this is!

I ask him, "What do you mean? Why would you say such things? Such hurtful things? What do you know?"

Look how mad he is. I must have done something horrible to this gentleman to make him despise me. Look at the hatred in his eyes... it's like... A resounding fear creeps up from the depths of my soul, and it's a fear that paralyzes my spirit and strangles my hope. It's like he knows who I am, and it sickens him. No, that's not it. I search his hate-filled gaze as my next thought terrifies me. It's like he knows not who but what I am.

"Yes, I should have destroyed you!" Adam continues to rant as he ignores my questions.

I'm about to yell back at him, but then he charges at me faster than a man his age should be capable of. He drops his cane as his feet thunder across the wooden floor. I retreat a few steps and out onto the balcony, but I'm not quick enough to escape his wrath.

He yells, "I must rip you out by your roots!" He seizes me by the throat and bellows, "You're a weed! A weed!"

I'm still holding the music box with my left hand, so I grab his arm with my right.

Stephanie shouts, "Hey! I'm supposed to kill Pandora! She's my quarry! So lay off!!"

Adam ignores her as if she's not even there, and he yells at me, "How dare you come to me. You're a vile wretched creature! You're a weed!"

He squeezes my throat, choking me as I drop the music box and use both hands to try to pry his death grip from my neck. I look at Stephanie as if I'm hoping she'll help me. Stephanie folds her arms and pouts like a child.

"The Council sent me to kill her. I'm supposed to kill her." Stephanie kicks at the air, throwing a tantrum as she states, "Me... I want to kill Pandora."

Adam doesn't hear Stephanie in the thralls of his rage and squeezes my neck harder. I have no luck prying his hands away. He's also stronger than he looks. I pull my knees up to my chest and kick with my feet. It does me no good and only makes him even madder. He lifts me up and slams me onto the balcony's railing, and the loose piece gives and falls to the ground. My back hurts where he slammed me into the railing, but I ignore the pain as I fight to survive. I start to lose consciousness.

Adam dangles me over the edge as he shouts at me, "Now the weed must die!"

He drops me before I lose consciousness and halfway down, I manage to grab a small root. It stops my fall but breaks under my weight, and I fall, landing in the Koi pond.

Adam's view...

Cerberus looks over the balcony and sulks as she says, "This isn't turning out how I imagined. Mr. Greenhouse, you ruined everything."

The weed's body surfaces face down as I glare at the pond, then turn, and head for the stairs. It isn't enough. I can't let this go, not again.

Cerberus follows behind me as she questions, "Did you kill her?"

"No, but I will make sure of it this time."

"This isn't fair." She stomps her foot before we reach the stairs. "I came all the way here to kill her and you won't let me. Why are you doing this? I want to kill Pandora!"

"Let you?" I turn and face Cerberus. "If you want to kill the weed, have at it, but be quick about it! Or I'll be the one to finish it!"

Less than a minute later...

Katharine's view...

I suck in water and wake myself up, and I lift my head out of the pond and cough. I'm dazed as I drag myself out of the water to a patch of land, not covered by lemongrass as I continue to cough and choke and after a few more minutes, I clear my lungs to the point where it feels like I'm breathing air again and not water. I crawl further up the bank. I can't seem to catch my breath, and I rub my bruised throat. I see a shoe by my hand and peer up. Stephanie stands before me.

"You..." I manage to say. "You were after me all along."

Stephanie's view...

I ignore her stupid statement, too upset with Pandora, and I yell at her, "Look what you did. You made Mr. Greenhouse go all lunatic on you and now you're weakened. I was so hoping to fight you at your best but no... You had to be all stupid and come to Mr. Greenhouse's home. I don't think you're even at fifty-five percent fighting capacity." I kick Pandora in the face, knocking her unconscious, and the force of the kick sends Pandora backward into the water. I put my hand on my hip. "I guess we don't always get what we want."
